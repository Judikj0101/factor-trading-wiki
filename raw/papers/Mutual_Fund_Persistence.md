Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance:  
Analysis of Holdings Returns

Abstract:  
 
Do mutual funds that performed well in the past select stocks that perform well in 
the future?  I construct mutual fund holdings returns by calculating the returns funds 
would have earned had they held all stocks owned as of the end of a year for the next 
year without trading or incurring any expenses.  I find that under almost all sorts on past 
performance, the future returns to mutual fund holdings are explained by the 4 -factor 
model of Carhart (1997).  This evidence supports the conclusions of Carhart (1 997) and 
establishes that the persistent underperformance of the bottom decile of mutual funds in 
Carhart (1997) is unrelated to mutual fund holdings.

 1 I. Introduction 
Mutual fund performance is a rich topic for academi c research.  The very 
existence of the mutual fund industry with its high  expenses and transaction costs is a 
puzzle to the efficient markets hypothesis.  If mar kets are efficient, why are so many 
resources invested in stock picking? 
The conventional wisdom is that at least some mutua l fund managers have stock-
picking skills.  Investors frequently look to past returns and historical ratings such as 
Morningstar for guidance on which funds will perfor m well in the future.  Successful 
fund managers are glorified in the media and turned  to for investment advice for years to 
come. 
The academic literature is much more mixed.  It is generally agreed that there is 
some persistence in mutual fund performance.1  However, the source of this persistence 
remains a topic of debate.  For example, Carhart (1 997) attributes almost all persistence 
in mutual fund performance to four-factor loadings,  expenses, and transaction costs.  On 
the other hand, Wermers, Yao, and Zhao (2007) finds  that “good” managers pick better-
performing stocks even after controlling for style characteristics. 
By examining the future performance of stocks held by “good” and “bad” mutual 
funds, I conclude that fund managers do not have st ock picking skills.  This paper adds to 
the literature by applying the performance-sorted p ortfolio methodology of Carhart 
(1997) to a dataset that includes returns on the un derlying holdings of mutual funds as 
well as the returns of the funds themselves.  Secti on II provides a brief review of the 
relevant literature.  Section III describes my data set.  Section IV introduces my analytical 
approach.  Section V discusses the results of my an alysis.  Section VI concludes.

II. Literature Review 
Mark Carhart’s 1997 Journal of Finance  article, “On Persistence in Mutual Fund 
Performance,” is the primary motivation for my anal ysis.  Carhart examines the returns of 
mutual funds from 1962 to 1993 to look for evidence  of performance persistence.  
Carhart’s primary analytical technique was to form performance decile portfolios of 
mutual funds on January 1 of each year based on ret urns over the past year.  The 
portfolios are then held for one year and monitored  for any abnormal performance.  If 
performance is persistent, funds that performed wel l in the past should perform well in 
the future, and the top decile portfolios should ou tperform the other portfolios. 
Carhart finds that past winners do outperform past losers.  However, most of this 
persistence is explained by a four-factor model inc luding factor-mimicking portfolios for 
the market return, size, book-to-market, and one-ye ar momentum.  Momentum is the 
biggest explanation of the persistence.  The remain ing persistence is mainly explained by 
fund expenses and transaction costs, which are high er in the lower performance deciles.  
Of the 8% difference in annual returns that Carhart  finds between the top and bottom 
deciles, 4.6% is explained by four-factor loadings,  0.7% is explained by expense 
differences, and 1.0% is explained by transaction c ost differences.  This leaves an 
unexplained return spread of 1.7%, almost all of wh ich is concentrated in the difference 
between the ninth and tenth deciles.  In other word s, Carhart finds some evidence that the 
very worst funds continue to underperform but finds  no evidence of persistent skill in any 
of the other deciles.

 3 Wermers, Yao, and Zhao (2007) analyzes the returns of mutual fund holdings and 
comes to the opposite conclusion that good managers  have significant stock-picking skill.  
Wermers et al identifies “good” managers based on p ast alpha estimates and then forms 
an equal weight portfolio that is long stocks held disproportionately by “good” managers 
and short stocks held disproportionately by “bad” m anagers.  They find that this trading 
strategy results in significant alpha, which they i nterpret as evidence of stock-picking 
skill.  A significant problem with this analysis is  that forming portfolios based on the 
same model used to analyze returns could bias the r esults.  Significant alpha could come 
from biases in the model.  Additionally, employing equal-weight portfolios of stocks will 
overweight small stocks.  I avoid these problems by  sorting based on returns instead of 
alpha estimates and forming equal-weight portfolios  of fund returns instead of stock 
returns. 
My analysis builds on Carhart (1997) by applying Ca rhart’s analytical approach 
to data on the returns of mutual fund holdings.  If  fund managers have stock-picking 
skills, the stocks they choose to buy should have h igh future returns.  Analyzing holdings 
returns without the noise of expenses and transacti ons should be a cleaner way to identify 
stock-picking skill.  Using this approach, I find n o compelling evidence of stock-picking 
skill. 
Additionally, examining the holdings returns helps to identify the source of the 
persistent underperformance of the worst funds in C arhart (1997).  Is this 
underperformance due to picking bad stocks, or is i t the result of transaction costs, hidden 
expenses, or other unobserved actions?  Given that I find no unexplained persistence in 
the holdings returns, I conclude that Carhart’s per sistent underperformance must be due

 4 to other actions of the mutual fund, likely transac tion costs from being forced to sell 
shares as investors pull out money. 
Finally, analyzing the holdings data is useful beca use any anomaly can be 
translated directly into a trading strategy.  Persi stence in mutual fund returns is interesting 
but difficult to exploit.  I can purchase the winni ng funds, but I cannot short the losers.  
On the other hand, if return persistence is present  in fund holdings, I can exploit this with 
a zero-investment portfolio by buying stocks held b y winning funds and shorting stocks 
held by losing funds.  The fact that this is a trad able strategy also makes holdings returns 
a better test of market efficiency. 
 
III. Data 
My dataset covers domestic equity mutual funds from  January 1980 to December 
2006.  My data includes information on both returns  and holdings.  As a result I am able 
to analyze both fund performance and the performanc e one would achieve by buying and 
holding a fund’s underlying securities. 
Monthly survivor-bias-free mutual fund returns data  comes from the CRSP 
mutual fund dataset available on WRDS.  Data is ava ilable starting in 1962.  I focus on 
post-1980 returns because this is the period for wh ich holdings data is available. 
Data on mutual fund holdings comes from the Thomson  Financial CDA/Spectrum 
dataset, also available on WRDS.  This dataset reco rds the positions mutual funds hold in 
individual securities.  The information comes from N-30D SEC filings, which are 
required to be filed twice a year by all mutual fun d companies.  The data is free from 
survivor bias and starts in 1980.  I link the mutua l fund returns data to the holdings data

WRDS.2 
To focus on domestic equity funds, I limit my analy sis to funds with an 
investment objective of growth, aggressive growth, or growth and income.  This 
eliminates international funds, as well as funds fo cused on bonds, metals, balanced, and 
unclassified strategies.  I also require that funds  be present in the returns data for at least 
one year, report holdings at least once during the preceding year, and have a valid link in 
MFLinks.  Finally, I consolidate repeat entries res ulting from multiple share classes in the 
CRSP Mutual Fund returns data by taking a weighted average according to total net 
assets.3 
To calculate holdings returns for each fund, I look  at how the fund’s reported 
holdings as of the end of a year performed over the  next year.  Fund holdings returns are 
calculated as the weighted average of CRSP return d ata for the individual stocks held by 
a fund.  January weights are based on the most rece ntly reported holdings positions.  
Subsequent weights are adjusted based on past return s.  The resulting holdings returns 
time series represents the returns an investor woul d receive by purchasing the most 
recently disclosed holdings of a fund on each Janua ry 1 and holding that portfolio for the 
next year. 
Table I summarizes the dataset.  In total, I have 1 8,401 fund-year observations 
(220,812 fund-months).  As expected, the number of funds increases over time, ranging 
from a minimum of 177 funds in 1983 (end-of-year 19 82) to a maximum of 1,480 funds 
                                                 
2 Wermers (2000) is an early example of this link. 
3 Redundant entries are not a problem in the holding s data because each fund with a single set of holdi ngs 
is only reported once.  The MFLinks file identifies  redundant entries in the CRSP data.  Because total  net 
assets are not always reported monthly, I use the m ost recent number available.  When historical total  net 
assets is not available I look forward for future v alues or weight the share class with $1 of total ne t assets.

 6 in 2000 (end-of-year 1999).  These counts are in li ne with datasets used by other 
researchers.  Wermers, Yao, and Zhao (2007) use a d ataset that ranges from 270 funds in 
1982 to 1,653 in 1997.  My lower counts are likely the result of my requirement that 
firms be alive for one year prior to their inclusio n in my analysis.  For the period of 1962 
to 1993, Carhart (1997) analyzes 1,892 total funds,  with an average of 500 fund each 
year. 
Table I also summarizes average monthly returns for  the funds and their holdings.  
Average monthly fund returns range from -1.25% in 1 981 to 2.26% in 1991.  As 
expected, variation over time roughly corresponds t o overall market patterns.  Funds 
generally, though not always, underperform their ho ldings.  On average the difference is 
2.04% annually, largely representing fund expenses and transaction costs. 
 
IV. Analysis 
My analytical technique is to apply the methodology  of Carhart (1997) and 
Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser (1993) to my holdi ngs returns dataset.  On January 1 of 
each year, I sort all mutual funds based on their a verage reported returns over the past 
year.  For robustness, I limit the dataset to funds  that reported returns in each of the past 
twelve months.  I then form ten equal-weight decile  portfolios based on the reported 
returns and hold their holdings for the next year.  The difference between my approach 
and that of Carhart (1997) is that Carhart analyzed  mutual fund returns over the next year 
whereas I analyze the performance of the funds’ yea r-end holdings.  The advantage of my 
approach is that I can look for stock-picking skill  without the noise introduced by fund 
expenses and transactions.  If managers have true s tock-picking skills, good managers

 7 (e.g. those with good past returns) should hold sto cks that will outperform the market in 
the future (e.g. over the course of the next year).   I directly test this hypothesis. 
As in Carhart (1997), I measure performance using t he Capital Asset Pricing 
Model (CAPM) of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) an d the 4-factor model of Carhart 
(1997).  The 4-factor model uses the market (rmrf),  size (smb), and value (hml) factors of 
Fama and French (1993) as well as a momentum (umd) factor based on Jegadeesh and 
Titman’s (1993) one-year momentum.  The model speci fications are: 
CAPM:  ittiiit ermrfr ++=βα                                                                               (1) 
4-Factor Model:  itiititiiit eumduhmlhsmbsrmrfbr +++++=α                      (2) 
where rit is the excess return on holdings portfolio i over the one-month T-Bill rate; rmrft 
is the excess return on the value-weighted portfoli o of all NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq 
stocks; and smbt, hmlt, and umdt are zero-investment factor-mimicking portfolios fo r size, 
book-to-market equity, and one-year momentum.4 
 
V. Results 
A. Mutual Fund Returns 
Before proceeding to my analysis of holdings return s, I first implement my 
analytical approach solely on reported mutual fund returns to ensure consistency with 
previous results.  Table II shows returns, CAPM est imates, and 4-factor estimates for the 
1981 to 2006 mutual fund returns in my data set.  C onsistent with Carhart (1997), there is 
significant persistence in returns.  The top decile  portfolio outperforms the bottom decile 
portfolio by 5.88% annually.  The CAPM explains non e of this persistence.  However, 
                                                 
4 All data on rmrf, smb, hml, umd, and the risk free  rate are from Ken French’s website.

 8 most of the persistence is explained by the four-fa ctor model.  In particular, significant 
momentum loadings explain much of the persistence.  Funds with high past returns are 
more likely to own stocks that performed well over the past year.  The momentum effect 
described by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) shows that  we should expect these stocks and 
funds to have high future returns.  Size also expla ins some of the persistence.  Good 
funds tend to load more heavily on small stocks.  T he value effect is relatively small and 
goes in the wrong way.  Four-factor alphas show som e variation across portfolios.  In 
particular, the bottom portfolio shows negative sep aration from the others.  However, 
differences in the alphas are not significant, sugg esting that persistence in mutual fund 
performance is almost entirely explained by the fou r-factor model.  These results are 
consistent with Carhart (1997) except that Carhart shows more separation between the 
bottom two portfolios. 
 Table III directly compares my analysis to Carhart  (1997).  Each row summarizes 
analysis on the spread between the top and bottom p ortfolio.  Row (1) is taken directly 
from Table III of Carhart (1997).  Row (2) is my re plication of Carhart (1997) for the 
same time period.5  Row (3) is the Table II analysis of mutual fund r eturns in my dataset.  
My monthly excess returns and CAPM results are very  close to Carhart’s suggesting that, 
as intended, my dataset and analytical techniques a re a good approximation of Carhart’s.  
Nonetheless, our four-factor results differ a bit.  Whereas Carhart shows a significant 
alpha difference (primarily driven by the bottom de cile), I do not detect any significant 
alpha.  The difference is driven by larger differen ces in momentum loadings in my

 9 analysis.  The rest of Table III (rows (4) to (9)) compares different time periods.  
Performance persistence does not appear to have cha nged much over time. 
Following Carhart (1997), a second analytical techn ique that I use in this paper is 
to sort portfolios based on past four-factor alpha estimates instead of past returns.  Table 
IV analyzes decile portfolios formed based on lagge d three-year four-factor alpha 
estimates.  Like Tables II and III, all results in Table IV, analyze reported returns of the 
mutual funds themselves.  Alpha-sorted portfolios s how little persistence in returns.  The 
top performers have negative hml loadings, creating  significant four-factor alpha 
differences across the portfolios. 
One interpretation of these results is that good ma nagers have stock-picking skill 
that is persistent over time, and that these skille d managers are more likely to invest in 
growth stocks.  As a result, they do not outperform  other funds in terms of returns, but 
they do have consistently positive alpha.  This is consistent with Davis (2001), which 
finds that positive alpha is more common among grow th funds. 
However, I am reluctant to read too much into these  results.  The analysis is 
highly susceptible to model misspecification.  As C arhart (1997) cautions, forming 
portfolios based on the same model used to analyze them risks identifying shortcomings 
of the model instead of picking up true stock-picki ng skill.  Past alpha estimates could 
simply be picking up omitted (or mispriced) risk fa ctors that are persistent into the future.  
Table IV is as much a test of the four-factor model  as it is a test of performance 
persistence.  Unless we are convinced that the four -factor model perfectly describes all 
returns, we should not be surprised that there is s ome alpha persistence.

 10 B. Holdings Returns 
I now turn to the primary contribution of this pape r, analysis of mutual fund 
holdings returns.  My primary result is that the ho ldings of past winning funds do not 
outperform the holdings of past losing funds, sugge sting that mutual fund managers do 
not possess stock picking skills. 
Table V shows the primary evidence for my no-stock- picking-skills result.  Funds 
are sorted into equal-weight portfolios based on th e past year of reported returns.  I then 
analyze the performance of their holdings over the next year.  In terms of returns, the 
holdings of winners outperform the holdings of lose rs by 4.20% annually, which is less 
than the difference that I found in the returns of the funds themselves (see Table II) and is 
not statistically significant.  More importantly, t he four-factor model completely explains 
all observed persistence in holdings returns.  Simi lar to the fund returns analysis in Table 
II, umd and hml explain the persistence while hml g oes somewhat in the wrong direction.  
The bottom line is that after adjusting for four-fa ctor loadings, the year-end holdings of 
“good” funds perform no better than the holdings of  “bad” funds over the next year. 
The differences between Tables II and V appear to b e driven by expenses and 
transaction costs.  Fund returns in Table II had a 1 – 10 spread alpha of 0.20% compared 
to a holdings returns spread alpha of 0.02% in Tabl e V.  This translates into a 2.16% 
annual difference, which is close the 1.7% return d ifference that Carhart attributes to 
expenses and transaction costs.  The remaining diff erence is within the margin of error 
and may be due to extra transaction costs facing th e worst-performing portfolio.  
Whatever is causing the apparent persistent underpe rformance of the worst funds in 
Carhart (1997) does not appear to be present in the  holdings returns.

 11 To examine whether return persistence is a short-ru n phenomenon that I miss with 
my year-long holding period, I look at monthly retu rns within the holding period.  Figure 
1 shows that alpha estimates do not systematically change across time.  In particular, 
there is no pattern to the 1 – 10 spread alpha, sug gesting that persistence is just as 
nonexistent in January as in any other month. 
To check the robustness of my results, I include se veral additional sorts to test 
other potential definitions of “good” funds.  First , I sort funds based on three-year returns 
instead of one-year returns.  If manager skill is p ersistent, the longer sort period should be 
less noisy.  Table VI shows that performance is act ually less persistent in the three-year 
sort.  Even the returns are the same across funds.  The difference seems to be driven by 
lower momentum loadings in the three year-sort.  Th is suggests that high-performing 
funds do not pursue momentum strategies, but rather  end up with momentum loadings as 
a byproduct of owning stocks that happened to do we ll.  A three-year sort weakens this 
effect. 
The next sort I try is based on past alpha estimate s.  This approach is related to the 
analysis of Wermers, Yao, and Zhao (2007), which id entifies “good” managers based on 
past alpha estimates.  Consistent with Wermers et a l, I find that holdings returns alpha is 
persistent when sorts are based on one-year lagged alpha estimates.  However, this is not 
compelling evidence of stock-picking skill.  Twelve  months of returns is not enough data 
to reliably fit the four-factor model.  Further, as  discussed before, alpha persistence could 
easily be the result of model misspecification as o pposed to stock-picking skill. 
Table VIII addresses the stock-picking skill vs. mo del misspecification issue by 
sorting portfolios based on longer, three-year lagg ed alpha estimates.  If stock-picking 

---
## Page 13

 12 skill is present and persistent, the three-year sor t should identify it with less noise.  
Instead, sorting based on the longer time period el iminates any significant persistence in 
either returns or four-factor alphas.  A likely exp lanation for this result is that the four-
factor model omits some risk factor, and that funds ’ loading on this risk factor is 
persistent over a one-to-two-year horizon but chang es over longer horizons.  This 
suggests that managers do not have stock-picking sk ills and casts doubts on the 
conclusions of Wermers, Yao, and Zhao (2007). 
 
VI. Conclusion 
Mutual fund managers do not appear to possess stock -picking skills.  Stocks held 
by past winners outperform those held by past loser s over the next year, but the 
persistence is explained by the four-factor model.  In particular, much of the performance 
is explained by momentum.  Funds that performed wel l over the past year are likely to 
hold recently appreciated stocks (the source of the  high fund returns), which benefit from 
momentum over the next year.  Persistence in mutual  fund returns appears to primarily be 
a manifestation of the Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) momentum effect. 
Persistence is even less prevalent in holdings retu rns than it is in fund returns.  
Carhart (1997) identified significant underperforma nce in the bottom decile of funds that 
could not be fully explained by the four factor mod el or expenses and transaction costs.  
By contrast, the holdings returns four-factor alpha s are almost exactly zero across all 
portfolios. 
The only evidence of stock-picking skill comes from  portfolios sorted based on 
one-year alpha estimates, and this is likely the by product of model misspecification.

 13 Sorting based on more reliable three-year alpha est imates eliminates any return 
persistence. 
The evidence in this paper suggests that even the “ best” mutual fund managers do 
not have stock picking skills.  Thus, investors sho uld not chase “hot” mutual funds, nor 
should they attempt to invest directly in the holdi ngs of “hot” funds.  Instead the prudent 
investor will focus solely on purchasing a diversif ied portfolio with his desired factor 
loadings at the lowest possible cost.

Data Summary
Average Monthly Return (%)The table summarizes the dataset constructed for this 
paper.  Mutual fund returns are from the CRSP mutual 
fund dataset.  Holdings returns are constructed from end-
of-year CDA/Spectrum reported holdings and CRSP stock 
return data.  The two datasets are linked using MFLinks.

Portfolios of Holdings Returns Formed on Lagged 3-Year Returns (1983 - 2006)
Mutual funds are sorted on January 1 each year from 1983 to 2006 into decile portfolios based on their previous three years' 
returns.  Portfolio returns represent equal-weighted (by fund) holdings returns.  Rmrf, smb, hml, and umd are returns of factor-
mimicking portfolios obtained from Ken French's website.  Parameter estimates are from OLS regressions.  The t-statistics are in 
parentheses.
