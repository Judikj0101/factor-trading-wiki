Hundreds of papers and factors attempt to explain the cross-section of expected returns.
Given this extensive data mining, it does not make sense to use the usual criteria forestablishing signiﬁcance. Which hurdle should be used for current research? Our paperintroduces a new multiple testing framework and provides historical cutoffs from the ﬁrstempirical tests in 1967 to today. A new factor needs to clear a much higher hurdle, withat-statistic greater than 3.0. We argue that most claimed research ﬁndings in ﬁnancial
economics are likely false. ( JEL C12, C52, G12)

Over forty years ago, one of the ﬁrst tests of the capital asset pricing model
(CAPM) found that the market beta was a signiﬁcant explanator of the cross-section of expected returns. The reported t-statistic of 2.57 in Fama and
MacBeth (1973, Table III) comfortably exceeded the usual cutoff of 2.0.However, since that time, hundreds of papers have tried to explain the cross-section of expected returns. Given the known number of factors that have beentried and the reasonable assumption that many more factors have been tried butdid not make it to publication, the usual cutoff levels for statistical signiﬁcance

may not be appropriate. We present a new framework that allows for multiple
tests and derive recommended statistical signiﬁcance levels for current researchin asset pricing.
We begin with 313 papers published in a selection of journals that study
cross-sectional return patterns. We provide recommended test thresholds fromthe ﬁrst empirical tests in 1967 to present day. We also project minimum t-
statistics through 2032, assuming the rate of “factor production” remains thesame as the last ten years. We present a taxonomy of historical factors, as wellas deﬁnitions.

Our research is related to a recent paper by McLean and Pontiff (2015),
who argue that certain stock market anomalies are less anomalous after beingpublished.
2Their paper tests the statistical biases emphasized in Leamer
(1978), Ross (1989), Lo and Mackinlay (1990), Fama (1991), and Schwert(2003).
Our paper also adds to the recent literature on biases and inefﬁciencies
in cross-sectional regression studies. Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010)critique the usual practice of using cross-sectional R
2s and pricing errors
to judge success and show that the explanatory power of many previouslydocumented factors are spurious. Our work focuses on evaluating the statisticalsigniﬁcance of a factor given the previous tests on other factors. Our goal isto use a multiple testing framework to both re-evaluate past research and toprovide a new benchmark for current and future research.
We tackle multiple hypothesis testing from the frequentist perspective.
Bayesian approaches to multiple testing and variable selection also exist.
3
However, the high dimensionality of the problem combined with the factthat we do not observe all the factors that have been tried poses a bigchallenge for Bayesian methods. While we propose a frequentist approach toovercome this missing data issue, it is unclear how to do this in the Bayesianframework. Nonetheless, we provide a detailed discussion of Bayesian methodsin paper.
Multiple testing has only recently gained traction in the ﬁnance literature.
For the literature on multiple testing corrections for data snooping biases,see Sullivan, Timmermann, and White (1999, 2001) and White (2000). Forresearch on data snooping and variable selection in predictive regressions,see Foster, Smith, and Whaley (1997), Cooper and Gulen (2006), and Lynchand Vital-Ahuja (2012). For applications of multiple testing approach in theﬁnance literature, see, for example, Shanken (1990), Ferson and Harvey (1999),

Boudoukh et al. (2007), and Patton and Timmermann (2010). More recently, a
multiple testing connection has been used to study technical trading and mutualfund performance, see, for example, Barras, Scaillet, and Wermers (2010),Bajgrowicz and Scaillet (2012), and Kosowski et al. (2006). Conrad, Cooper,and Kaul (2003) point out that data snooping accounts for a large proportionof the return differential between equity portfolios that are sorted by ﬁrmcharacteristics. Bajgrowicz, Scaillet, and Treccani (2013) show that multipletesting methods help eliminate a large proportion of spurious jumps detectedusing conventional test statistics for high-frequency data. Holland, Basu,and Sun (2010) emphasize the importance of multiple testing in accountingresearch. Our paper is consistent with the theme of this literature.
There are limitations to our framework. First, should all factor discoveries be
treated equally? We think no.Afactor derived from a theory should have a lowerhurdle than a factor discovered from a purely empirical exercise. Economictheories are based on a few economic principles and, as a result, there is lessroom for data mining. Nevertheless, whether suggested by theory or empiricalwork, a t-statistic of 2.0 is too low. Second, our tests focus on unconditional
tests. While the unconditional test might consider the factor marginal, it ispossible that this factor is very important in certain economic environmentsand not important in other environments. These two caveats need to be takeninto account when using our recommended signiﬁcance levels for current assetpricing research.
While our focus is on the cross-section of equity returns, our message applies
to many different areas of ﬁnance. For instance, Frank and Goyal (2009)investigate around thirty variables that have been documented to explain thecapital structure decisions of public ﬁrms. Welch and Goyal (2008) examinethe performance of a dozen variables that have been shown to predict marketexcess returns. Novy-Marx (2014) proposes unconventional variables to predictanomaly returns. These three applications are ideal settings to employ multipletesting methods.
1. The Search Process
Our goal is not to catalog every asset pricing paper ever published. We narrow
the focus to papers that propose and test new factors. For example, Sharpe(1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966) all theoretically proposed (at roughlythe same time), a single-factor model—the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).Following Fama and MacBeth (1973), there are hundreds of papers that test theCAPM. We include the theoretical papers, as well as the ﬁrst paper to providetest statistics. We do not include the hundreds of papers that test the CAPMin different contexts, for example, various international markets and differenttime periods. We do, however, include papers, such as Kraus and Litzenberger(1976), who test the market factor, as well as one additional risk factor linkedto the market factor.

Sometimes different papers propose different empirical proxies for the same
type of economic risk. Although they may look similar from a theoreticalstandpoint, we still include them. An example is the empirical proxies foridiosyncratic ﬁnancial constraints risk. While Lamont, Polk, and Saa-Requejo(2001) use the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index to proxy for ﬁrm-levelﬁnancial constraints, Whited and Wu (2006) estimate their own constraint indexbased on the ﬁrst-order conditions of ﬁrms’ optimization problem. We includeboth even though they are likely highly correlated.
Since our focus is on factors that can broadly explain return patterns, we
omit papers that focus on a small group of stocks or a short period of time. Thiswill, for example, exclude a substantial amount of empirical corporate ﬁnanceresearch that studies event-driven return movements.
4
Certain theoretical models lack immediate empirical content. Although they
could be empirically relevant once suitable proxies are constructed, we chooseto exclude them.
With these rules in mind, we narrow our search to generally the top journals
in ﬁnance, economics, and accounting. To include the most recent research, wesearch for working papers on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN).
Working papers pose a challenge because there are thousands of them, and they
have not been subjected to peer review. We choose a subset of papers that wesuspect are in review at top journals, have been presented at top conferences,or are due to be presented at top conferences. We end with 63 working papers.In total, we focus on 313 articles, among which are 250 published articles. Wecatalogue 316 different factors.
5
Our collection of 316 factors likely underrepresents the factor population.
First, we generally only consider top journals. Second, we are selective inchoosing only a handful of working papers. Third, sometimes there are manyvariants of the same characteristic, and we usually only include the mostrepresentative ones. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we should bemeasuring the number of factors tested (which is unobservable)—that is, wedo not observe the factors that were tested but that failed to pass the usualsigniﬁcance levels and were never published (see Fama 1991). Our multipletesting framework tries to account for this possibility.
4See Kothari and Warner (2007) for a survey on event studies. More speciﬁcally, three criteria help differentiate
our risk factors from event signals in corporate ﬁnance. First, while we are generally considering returns realizedat the monthly or lower frequency intervals for risk factors, it is routine for event studies to consider daily or evenhigher frequency returns. Second, portfolio sorts based on risk factors typically cover the entire cross-section ofstocks, whereas event studies usually focus on a much smaller group of securities that are affected by the eventsignal. Finally, portfolio sorts based on risk factors are usually repeated at a ﬁxed time interval, whereas eventsmay happen sporadically.
5As already mentioned, some of these factors are highly correlated. For example, we include four versions of
idiosyncratic volatility, that is, Fama and MacBeth (1973), Ali, Hwang, and Trombley (2003), Ang et al. (2006),and Fu (2009).

2. Factor Taxonomy
To facilitate our analysis, we group the factors into different categories. We start
with two broad categories: “common” and individual ﬁrm “characteristics.”“Common” means the factor can be viewed as a proxy for a common source ofrisk. Risk exposure to this factor or its innovations is supposed to help explaincross-sectional return patterns. “Characteristics” means the factor is speciﬁcto the security or portfolio. A good example is Fama and MacBeth (1973).
While the beta against the market return is systematic (exposure to a common
risk factor), the standard deviation of the market model residual is not basedon a common factor—it is a property of the individual ﬁrm, that is, it is anidiosyncratic characteristic.
Strictly speaking, a risk factor should be a variable that has unpredictable
variation through time. Moreover, assets’ risk exposures to this factor needto be able to explain the cross-sectional return patterns. Based on thesecriteria, individual ﬁrm characteristics should not qualify as risk factorsbecause characteristics are preknown and have limited time-series variation.However, we interpret ﬁrm characteristics in a broader sense. If a certain ﬁrmcharacteristic is found to be correlated with the cross-section of expectedreturns, a long-short portfolio can usually be constructed to proxy for theunderlying unknown risk factor. It is this unknown risk factor that we havein mind when we classify particular ﬁrm characteristics as risk factors.
Based on the unique properties of the proposed factors, we further divide the
“common” and “characteristics” groups into ﬁner categories. In particular, wedivide “common” into “ﬁnancial,” “macro,” “microstructure,” “behavioral,”“accounting,” and “other.” We divide “characteristics” into the same categories,except we omit the “macro” classiﬁcation, which is common, by deﬁnition. Thefollowing table provides further details on the deﬁnitions of these subcategoriesand gives examples for each.
3. Adjusted t-statistics in Multiple Testing
3.1 Why multiple testing?
Given that so many papers have attempted to explain the same cross-section
of expected returns, statistical inference should not be based on a “single” testperspective. Our goal is to provide guidance as to the appropriate signiﬁcancelevel using a multiple testing framework. When just one hypothesis is tested,we use the term “individual test,” “single test,” and “independent test”interchangeably.
6
Strictly speaking, different papers study different sample periods and hence
focus on different cross-sections of expected returns. However, the bulk of thepapers we consider have substantial overlapping sample periods. Also, if one

believes that cross-sectional return patterns are stationary, then these papers are
studying roughly the same cross-section of expected returns.
We want to emphasize that there are many forces that make our guidance
lenient; that is, a credible case can be made for an even higher threshold fordiscovery. We have already mentioned that we only sample a subset of researchpapers and the “publication bias/hidden tests” issue (i.e., it is difﬁcult to publisha nonresult).
7However, there is another publication bias that is more subtle.
In many scientiﬁc ﬁelds, replication studies routinely appear in top journals.
That is, a factor is discovered, and others try to replicate it. In ﬁnance and
economics, it is very difﬁcult to publish replication studies. Hence, there isa bias towards publishing “new” factors rather than rigorously verifying theexistence of discovered factors.
There are two ways to deal with the bias introduced by multiple
testing: out-of-sample validation and using a statistical framework thatallows for multiple testing.
8When feasible, out-of-sample testing is the
cleanest way to rule out spurious factors. In their study of anomalies,McLean and Pontiff (2015) take the out-of-sample approach. Their results showa degradation of performance of identiﬁed anomalies after publication, whichis consistent with the statistical bias. It is possible that this degradation is largerthan they document. In particular, they drop 12 of their 97 anomalies becausethey could not replicate the in-sample performance of published studies. Giventhat these nonreplicable anomalies were not even able to survive routine datarevisions, they are likely to be insigniﬁcant strategies, either in-sample or out-of-sample. The degradation from the original published “alpha” is 100% forthese strategies, which would lead to a higher average rate of degradation fortheir strategies.
While the out-of-sample approach has many strengths, it has one important
drawback: it cannot be used in real time. To make real time assessments in theout-of-sample approach, it is common to hold out some data. However, this isnot genuine out-of-sample testing as all the data are observable to researchers.Areal out-of-sample test requires data in the future. In contrast to many tests in thephysical sciences (where new data can be created for an experiment), we oftenneed years of data to do an out-of-sample test. We pursue the multiple testingframework because it yields immediate guidance on whether a discovered factoris real.
3.2 A multiple testing framework
In statistics, multiple testing refers to simultaneous testing of more than one
hypothesis. The statistics literature was aware of this multiplicity problem at
7See Rosenthal (1979) for one of the earliest and most inﬂuential works on publication bias.
8Another approach to test factor robustness is to look across multiple asset classes. This approach has been
followed in several recent papers, for example, Asness et al. (2013) and Koijen et al. (2012).

least 60 years ago.9Early generations of multiple testing procedures focus on
the control of the family-wise error rate (see Section 4.3.1). More recently,increasing interest in multiple testing from the medical literature has spurredthe development of methods that control the false discovery rate (see Section4.3.2). Multiple testing is an active research area in both the statistics and themedical literature.
10
Despite the rapid development of multiple testing methods, they have not
attracted much attention in the ﬁnance literature. Moreover, most of the researchthat does involve multiple testing focuses on the Bonferroni adjustment,
11
which is known to be too stringent. Our paper aims to ﬁll this gap.
First, we introduce a hypothetical example to motivate a more general
framework. In Table 2, we categorize the possible outcomes of a multipletesting exercise. Panel A displays an example of what the literature could havediscovered, and panel B notationalizes panelAto ease our subsequent deﬁnitionof the general type I error rate—the chance of making at least one false discoveryor the expected fraction of false discoveries.
Our example in panel A assumes 100 published factors (denoted as R).
Among these factors, suppose 50 are false discoveries and the rest are real
ones. In addition, researchers have tried 600 other factors, but none were foundto be signiﬁcant. Among them, 500 are truly insigniﬁcant, but the other 100 aretrue factors. The total number of tests ( M) is 700. Two types of mistakes are
made in this process: 50 factors are falsely discovered to be true (type I error orfalse positive), while 100 true factors are buried in unpublished work (type IIerror or false negative). The usual statistical control in a multiple testing contextaims at reducing “50” or “50/100,” the absolute or proportionate occurrence of

false discoveries, respectively. Of course, we only observe published factors
because factors that are tried and found to be insigniﬁcant rarely make it topublication.
12This poses a challenge since the usual statistical techniques only
handle the case in which all test results are observable.
Panel B deﬁnes the corresponding terms in a formal statistical testing
framework. In a factor testing exercise, the typical null hypothesis is that afactor is not signiﬁcant. Therefore, a factor being insigniﬁcant means the nullhypothesis is “true.” Using “0” (“1”) to indicate the null is true (false) and“a” (“r”) to indicate “not reject” (“reject”), we can easily summarize panel
A. For instance, N
0|rmeasures the number of rejections when the null is true
(i.e., the number of false discoveries) and N1|ameasures the number of failed
rejections when the null is false (i.e. the number of missed discoveries). Toavoid confusion, we try not to use standard statistical language in describingour notation but rather use words unique to our factor testing context. Thegeneric notation in panel B is convenient in formally deﬁning different typesof errors and describing adjustment procedures in subsequent sections.
3.3 Type I and type II errors
For a single hypothesis test, a value αis used to control type I error rate:
the probability of ﬁnding a factor to be signiﬁcant when it is not. The αis
sometimes called the “level of signiﬁcance.” In a multiple testing framework,restricting each individual test’s type I error rate at αis not enough to control
the overall probability of false discoveries. The intuition is that, under the nullthat all factors are insigniﬁcant, it is very likely for an event with αprobability
to occur when many factors are tested. In multiple hypothesis testing, we needmeasures of the type I error that help us simultaneously evaluate the outcomesof many individual tests.
To gain some intuition about plausible measures of type I error, we return to
panel B of Table 2. N
0|randN1|acount the total number of the two types of
errors: N0|rcounts false discoveries, while N1|acounts missed discoveries.
As generalized from single hypothesis testing, the type I error in multiple
hypothesis testing is also related to false discoveries, by which we concludea factor is “signiﬁcant” when it is not. But, by deﬁnition, we must drawseveral conclusions in multiple hypothesis testing, and there is a possible falsediscovery for each. Therefore, plausible deﬁnitions of the type I error shouldtake into account the joint occurrence of false discoveries.
The literature has adopted at least two ways of summarizing the “joint
occurrence.” One approach is to count the total number of false discoveries
12Examples of the publication of unsuccessful factors include Fama and MacBeth (1973) and Ferson and Harvey
(1993). Fama and MacBeth (1973) show that squared beta and standard deviation of the market model residualhave an insigniﬁcant role in explaining the cross-section of expected returns. However, the inclusion of thesetwo variables was a result of a falsiﬁcation experiment rather than a search for new factors. Overall, it is rareto publish “nonresults” and all instances of published nonresults are coupled with signiﬁcant results for otherfactors.

N0|r.N0|rgreater than zero suggests incorrect statistical inference for the
overall multiple testing problem—the occurrence of which we should limit.
Therefore, the probability of event N0|r>0 should be a meaningful quantity
for us to control. Indeed, this is the intuition behind the family-wise error rateintroduced later. On the other hand, when the total number of discoveries Ris
large, one or even a few false discoveries may be tolerable. In this case, N
0|r
is no longer a suitable measure; a certain false discovery proportion may be
more desirable. Unsurprisingly, the expected value of N0|r/Ris the focus of
false discovery rate, the second type of control.
3.3.1 Family-wise error rate. The two aforementioned measures are the
most widely used in the statistics literature. Moreover, many other techniquescan be viewed as extensions of these measures. Holm (1979) is the ﬁrst toformally deﬁne the family-wise error rate. Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)deﬁne and study the false discovery rate. Alternative deﬁnitions of error rateinclude per comparison error rate (Saville 1990), positive false discovery rate(Storey 2003), and generalized false discovery rate (Sarkar and Guo 2009). Wenow describe the two leading approaches in detail.
The family-wise error rate (FWER) is the probability of at least one type I
error:
FWER= Pr(N
0|r≥1).
FWER measures the probability of even a single false discovery, regardless
of the total number of tests. For instance, researchers might test 100 factors;FWER measures the probability of incorrectly identifying one or more factorsto be signiﬁcant. Given signiﬁcance or threshold level α, we explore two
existing methods (Bonferroni and Holm’s adjustment) to ensure FWER doesnot exceed α. Even as the number of trials increases, FWER still measures the
probability of at least one false discovery. This absolute control is in contrastto the proportionate control afforded by the false discovery rate (FDR), deﬁnedbelow.
3.3.2 False discovery rate. The false discovery proportion (FDP) is the
proportion of type I errors:
FDP=⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩N
0|r
RifR>0,
0i f R=0.
The false discovery rate (FDR) is deﬁned as
FDR= E[FDP ].
FDR measures the expected proportion of false discoveries among all
discoveries. It is less stringent (i.e., leads to more discoveries) than FWER
14

## Page 11

… and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns
and usually much less so when many tests are performed.13Intuitively, this is
because FDR allows N0|rto grow in proportion to R, whereas FWER measures
the probability of making even a single type I error.
Returning to example A, panel A shows that a false discovery event has
occurred under FWER since N0|r=50≥1 and the realized FDP is high,
50/100=50%. This suggests that the probability of false discoveries (FWER)
and the expected proportion of false discoveries (FDR) may both be high.14
The remedy, as suggested by many FWER and FDR adjustment procedures,
is to lower p-value thresholds for these hypotheses ( p-value, as deﬁned in our
context, is the single test probability of having a t-statistic that is at least as
large as the observed one under the null hypothesis). In terms of panel A, thiswould turn some of the ﬁfty false discoveries insigniﬁcant and push them intothe “Unpublished” category. Hopefully, the ﬁfty true discoveries would survivethis change in p-value threshold and remain signiﬁcant, which is only possible
if their p-values are relatively small.
On the other hand, type II errors—the mistake of missing true factors—are
also important in multiple hypothesis testing. Similar to type I errors, both thetotal number of missed discoveries N
1|aand the fraction of missed discoveries
among all abandoned tests N1|a/(M−R) are frequently used to measure the
severity of type II errors.15Ideally, one would like to simultaneously minimize
the chance of committing a type I error and that of committing a type II error.In our context, we would like to include as few insigniﬁcant factors (i.e., aslow a type I error rate) as possible and simultaneously as many signiﬁcantones (i.e., as low a type II error rate) as possible. Unfortunately, this is not
13There is a natural ordering between FDR and FWER. Theoretically, FDR is always bounded above by FWER,
that is, FDR≤FWER . To see this, by deﬁnition,
FDR =E[N0|r
R|R>0]Pr(R>0)
≤E[I(N0|r≥1)|R>0]Pr(R>0)
=Pr((N0|r≥1)∩(R>0))
≤Pr(N0|r≥1)=FWER ,
where I(N0|r≥1)is an indicator function of event N0|r≥1. This implies that procedures that control FWER under
a certain signiﬁcance level automatically control FDR under the same signiﬁcance level. In our context, a factor
discovery criterion that controls FWER at αalso controls FDR at α.
14Panel A only shows one realization of the testing outcome for a certain testing procedure (e.g., single tests). Toevaluate FWER and FDR, both of which are expectations and hence depend on the underlying joint distributionof the testing statistics, we need to know the population of the testing outcomes. To give an example that iscompatible with panel A, we assume that the t-statistics for the 700 hypotheses are independent. Moreover, we
assume the t-statistic for a false factor follows a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance of 1.0, that
is,N
(0,1); for a true factor, we assume its t-statistic follows a normal distribution with mean of 2.0 and variance
of 1.0, that is, N(2,1). Under these assumptions about the joint distribution of the test statistics, we ﬁnd via
simulations that FWER is 100% and FDR is 26%, both exceeding 5%.

feasible: as in single hypothesis testing, a decrease in the type I error rate often
leads to an increase in the type II error rate and vice versa. We therefore seeka balance between the two types of errors. A standard approach is to specify asigniﬁcance level αfor the type I error rate and derive testing procedures that
aim to minimize the type II error rate, that is, maximize power, among the classof tests with type I error rate at most α.
When comparing two testing procedures that can both achieve a signiﬁcance
levelα, it seems reasonable to use their type II error rates. However, when
we have multiple tests, the exact type II error rate typically depends on a setof unknown parameters and is therefore difﬁcult to assess.
16To overcome this
difﬁculty, researchers frequently use the distance of the actual type I error rate tosome prespeciﬁed signiﬁcance level as the measure for a procedure’s efﬁciency.Intuitively, if a procedure’s actual type I error rate is strictly below α,w ec a n
probably push this error rate closer to αby making the testing procedure less
stringent, that is, a higher p-value threshold so there will be more discoveries. In
doing so, the type II error rate is presumably lowered given the inverse relationbetween the two types of error rates. Therefore, once a procedure’s actual typeI error rate falls below a prespeciﬁed signiﬁcance level, we want it to be asclose as possible to that signiﬁcance level in order to achieve the smallest typeII error rate. Ideally, we would like a procedure’s actual type I error rate to beexactly the same as the given signiﬁcance level.
17
Both FWER and FDR are important concepts that are widely applied in
many scientiﬁc ﬁelds. However, based on speciﬁc applications, one may bepreferred over the other. When the number of tests is very large (e.g., a million),FWER controlling procedures tend to become very tough as they control for theoccurrence of even a single false discovery among one million tests. As a result,they often lead to a very limited number of discoveries, if any. Conversely,FWER control is more desirable when the number of tests is relatively small,in which case more discoveries can be achieved and at the same time trusted.In the context of our paper, we are sure that many tests have been tried in theﬁnance literature. Although there are around 300 published ones, hundreds oreven thousands of factors could have been constructed and tested. However, itis not clear whether this number should be considered “large” compared to the
16In single hypothesis testing, the type II error is a function of the unknown true parameter value—in our context,
the population factor mean return—under the alternative hypothesis. By tracing out all possible values underthe alternative hypothesis, we obtain the type II error function. The situation is more complicated in multiplehypothesis testing because the type II error depends on multiple parameters that correspond to the collection ofalternative hypotheses for all the tests. Hence, the type II error function is multivariate when there are multipletests. See Zehetmayer and Posch (2010) for power estimation in large-scale multiple testing problems.
17In our framework, individual p-values are sufﬁcient statistics for us to make adjustment for multiple tests. Each
individual p-value represents the probability of having a t-statistic that is at least as large as the observed one
under the null hypothesis. What happens under the alternative hypotheses (i.e., type II error rate) does not directlycome into play because hypothesis testing in the frequentist framework has a primary focus on the type I errorrate. When we deviate from the frequentist framework and consider Bayesian methods, the type II error ratebecomes more important because Bayesian odds ratios put the type I and type II error rates on the same footing.

in choosing between FWER and FDR. Given this difﬁculty, we do not take astand on the relative appropriateness of these two measures but instead provideadjusted p-values for both. Researchers can compare their p-values with these
benchmarks to see whether FDR or even FWER is satisﬁed.
3.4 p-value adjustment: Three approaches
The statistics literature has developed many methods to control both FWER
and FDR.
19We choose to present the three most well-known adjustments:
Bonferroni, Holm, and Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli (BHY). BothBonferroni and Holm control FWER, and BHY controls FDR. Depending onhow the adjustment is implemented, they can be categorized into two generaltypes of corrections: a “single-step” correction equally adjusts each p-value,
and a “sequential” correction is an adaptive procedure that depends on the entiredistribution of p-values. Bonferroni is a single-step procedure, whereas Holm
and BHY are sequential procedures. Table 3 summarizes the two properties ofthe three methods.
Suppose there are in total Mtests and we choose to set FWER at α
wand
FDR at αd. In particular, we consider an example with the total number of tests
M=10 to illustrate how different adjustment procedures work. For our main
results, we set both αwandαdat 5%. Table 4, panel A, lists the t-statistics and
the corresponding p-values for ten hypothetical tests. The numbers in the table
are broadly consistent with the magnitude of t-statistics that researchers report
for factor signiﬁcance. Note that all ten factors will be “discovered” if we testone hypothesis at a time. Multiple testing adjustments will usually generatedifferent results.
20
3.4.1 Bonferroni’s adjustment. Bonferroni’s adjustment is as follows:
• Reject any hypothesis with p-value ≤αw
M:
pBonferroni
i =min[ M×pi,1].
18For instance, tens of thousands of tests are performed in the analysis of DNA microarrays. See Farcomeni (2007)
for more applications of multiple testing in medical research.
19Methods that control FWER include Holm (1979), Hochberg (1988), and Hommel (1988). Methods that controlFDR include those of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), Benjamini and Liu (1999), and Benjamini and Yekutieli(2001).

set at 5%. The cutoff p-value for Bonferroni is 0.5%, for Holm is 0.60%, and for BHY is 0.85%.
Bonferroni applies the same adjustment to each test. It inﬂates the original
p-value by the number of tests M; the adjusted p-value is compared with the
threshold value αw.
Example 4.4.1 To apply Bonferroni’s adjustment to the example in Table 4,
we simply multiply all the p-values by ten and compare the new p-values
withαw=5%. Equivalently, we can look at the original p-values and consider
the cutoff of 0 .5%(=αw/10). This leaves the t-statistic of tests 4, 7, and 8 as
signiﬁcant, which are highlighted in panel B.
Using the notation in panel B of Table 2 and assuming M0of the Mnull
hypotheses are true, Bonferroni operates as a single-step procedure that can beshown to restrict FWER at levels less than or equal to ( M
0×αw)/M, without
any assumption on the dependence structure of the p-values. Since M0≤M,
Bonferroni also controls FWER at level αw.21
21The number of true nulls M0is unknown, so we usually cannot make Bonferroni more powerful by increasing
αwtoˆα=Mαw/M0(note that M0ˆα/M =αw). However some papers, including those by Schweder and Spjotvoll

3.4.2 Holm’s adjustment. Sequential methods have been proposed to adjust
p-values in multiple hypothesis testing.22They are motivated by a seminal
paper by Schweder and Spjotvoll (1982), who suggest a graphical presentationof the multiple testing p-values. In particular, using N
pto denote the number of
tests that have a p-value exceeding p, Schweder and Spjotvoll (1982) suggest
plotting Npagainst (1 −p). When pis not very small (e.g., p>0.2), it is very
likely that the associated test is from the null hypothesis. In this case, the p-
value for a null test can be shown to be uniformly distributed between 0 and1. It then follows that for a large pand under independence among tests, the
expected number of tests with a p-value exceeding pequals T
0(1−p), where
T0is the number of null hypotheses, i.e., E(Np)=T0(1−p). By plotting Np
against (1 −p), the graph should be approximately linear with slope T0for large
p-values. Points on the graph that substantially deviate from this linear pattern
should correspond to non-null hypotheses, i.e., discoveries. The gist of thisargument—large and small p-values should be treated differently—has been
distilled into many variations of sequential adjustment methods, among whichwe will introduce Holm’s method that controls FWER and BHY’s method thatcontrols FDR.
Holm’s adjustment is as follows:
• Order the original p-values such that p
(1)≤p(2)≤···p(b)≤···≤ p(M), and
let the associated null hypotheses be H(1),H(2),···H(b)···,H(M).
• Letkbe the minimum index such that p(b)>αw
M+1−b.
• Reject the null hypotheses H(1)···H(k−1)(i.e., declare these factors
signiﬁcant), but not H(k)···H(M).
The equivalent adjusted p-value is therefore
pHolm
(i)=min[max
j≤i{(M−j+1)p(j)},1].
Holm’s adjustment is a step-down procedure: for the ordered p-values, we start
from the smallest p-value and go down to the largest one.23Ifkis the smallest
index that satisﬁes p(b)>αw
M+1−b, we will reject all tests whose ordered index is
below k.
To explore how Holm’s adjustment procedure works, suppose kis the
smallest index such that p(b)>αw
M+1−b. This means that for b<k ,p(b)≤αw
M+1−b.
In particular, for b=1, Bonferroni equals Holm, that is,αw
M=αw
M+1−(b=1); forb=2,
(1982) and Hochberg and Benjamini (1990), try to improve the power of Bonferroni by estimating M0. We try to
achieve the same goal by using either Holm’s procedure, which also controls FWER, or procedures that controlFDR, an alternative deﬁnition of type I error rate.
22Here, “sequential” refers to the fact that we adjust the ordered p-values sequentially. It does not mean that the
individual tests arrive sequentially.
23Viewing small p-values as “up” and large p-values as “down,” Holm’s procedure is a “step-down” procedure
in that it goes from small p-values to large ones. This terminology is consistent with the statistics literature. Of
course, small p-values are associated with “large” values of the test statistics.

αw
M<αw
M+1−(b=2), so Holm is less stringent than Bonferroni. Since less stringent
hurdles are applied to the second to the ( k−1)thp-values, more discoveries are
generated under Holm’s than Bonferroni’s adjustment.
Example 4.4.2 To apply Holm’s adjustment to the example in Table 4, we
ﬁrst order the p-values in ascending order and try to locate the smallest index
kthat makes p(b)>αw
M+1−b. Table 4, panel C, shows the ordered p-values and
the associatedαw
M+1−b’s. Starting from the smallest p-value and going up, we
see that p(b)is belowαw
M+1−buntilb=5, at which point p(5)is aboveαw
10+1−5.
Therefore, the smallest bthat satisﬁes p(b)>αw
M+1−bis 5 and we reject the null
hypothesis for the ﬁrst four ordered tests (we discover four factors) and fail toreject the null for the remaining six tests. The original labels for the rejectedtests are in the second row in panel C. Compared to Bonferroni, one more factor(test 9) is discovered; that is, four factors rather than three are signiﬁcant. Ingeneral, Holm’s approach leads to more discoveries and all discoveries underBonferroni are also discoveries under Holm’s criteria.
Like Bonferroni, Holm also restricts FWER at α
wwithout any requirement
on the dependence structure of p-values. It can also be shown that Holm
is uniformly more powerful than Bonferroni in that tests rejected (factorsdiscovered) under Bonferroni are always rejected under Holm, but not viceversa. In other words, Holm leads to at least as many discoveries as Bonferroni.Given the dominance of Holm over Bonferroni, one might opt to only useHolm. We include Bonferroni because it is the most widely used adjustmentand a simple single-step procedure.
3.4.3 Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli’s adjustment. Benjamini,
Hochberg, and Yekutieli’s (BHY) adjustment is as follows:
• As with Holm’s procedure, we order the original p-values such that
p
(1)≤p(2)≤···p(b)≤···≤ p(M)and let associated null hypotheses be
H(1),H(2),···H(b)···,H(M).
• Letkbe the maximum index such that p(b)≤b
M×c(M)αd.
• Reject null hypotheses H(1)···H(k), but not H(k+1)···H(M).
The equivalent adjusted p-value is deﬁned sequentially as

ip(i)]i fi≤M−1,
where, c(M) is a function of the total number of tests Mand controls for the
generality of the test. The larger c(M) is the more stringent test and hence
is more general in guarding against dependency among the test statistics. Inparticular, Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001) show that setting c(M)a t

allows the procedure to work under arbitrary dependency among the test
statistics. We focus on this speciﬁcation due to its generality but will discusswhat happens under alternative speciﬁcations of c(M).
In contrast to Holm’s, BHY’s method starts with the largest p-value and goes
to the smallest one. If kis the largest index that satisﬁes p

will reject tests (discover factors) whose ordered index is below or equal to
k. Also, note that αd(signiﬁcance level for FDR) is chosen to be the same
asαw(signiﬁcance level for FWER). The signiﬁcance level is subjective in
nature. Here, we choose the same signiﬁcance level to make an apples-to-applescomparison between FDR and FWER adjustment procedures. We discuss thischoice in more detail in Section 4.6.
To explore how BHY works, let kbe the largest index, such that p
(b)≤
b
M×c(M)αd. This means that for b>k ,p(b)>b
M×c(M)αd. In particular, we have
p(k+1)>(k+1)
M×c(M)αd,p(k+2)>(k+2)
M×c(M)αd,… ,p(M)>M
M×c(M)αd. We see that the
(k+1)th to the last null hypotheses, not rejected, are compared to numbers
smaller than αd, the usual signiﬁcance level in single hypothesis testing.
By being stricter than single hypothesis tests, BHY guarantees that the falsediscovery rate, which depends on the joint distribution of all the test statistics, isbelow the prespeciﬁed signiﬁcance level. See Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)for details on the proof.
Example 4.4.3 To apply BHY’s adjustment to the example in Table 4, we ﬁrst
order the p-values in ascending order and try to locate the largest index kthat
satisﬁes p
(b)≤b
M×c(M)αd. Table 4, panel D, shows the ordered p-values and
the associatedb
M×c(M)αd’s. Starting from the largest p-value and going down,
we see that p(b)is aboveb
M×c(M)αduntilb=6, at which point p(6)is below
6
10×2.93αd. Therefore, the smallest bthat satisﬁes p(b)≤b
M×c(M)αdis 6, and we
reject the null hypothesis for the ﬁrst six ordered tests and fail to reject for the
remaining four tests. In the end, BHY leads to six signiﬁcant factors (tests 8,7, 4, 9, 6, and 2), three more than Bonferroni and two more than Holm.
In summary, for single tests, using the usual 5% cutoff, 10 out of 10 are
discovered. Allowing for multiple tests, the cutoffs are far smaller, with BHYat 0.85%, Holm at 0.60%, and Bonferroni at 0.5%.
The choice of c(M) determines the generality of BHY’s procedure.
Intuitively, when c(M) is larger, then the more difﬁcult it is to satisfy the
inequality p
(b)≤b
M×c(M)αd, and hence there will be fewer discoveries. This
makes it easier to restrict the false discovery rate below a given signiﬁcance
level since fewer discoveries are made. In the original work that developsthe concept of false discovery rate and related testing procedures, c(M)
is set equal to one. Under this choice, BHY is only valid when the teststatistics are independent or positively dependent. With our choice of c(M)
(i.e.,c(M)=/summationtext

While all ten factors would be discovered undersingle hypothesis testing, only three to six factors would be discovered undera multiple hypothesis test. Although single hypothesis testing guarantees thetype I error of each test meets a given signiﬁcance level, meeting the morestringent FWER or FDR bound will lead us to discard a number of factors.

period from 1980 to 1991, only about one factor is discovered per year. This
number has grown to around ﬁve for the 1991–2003 period, during whichtime a number of papers, such as Fama and French (1992), Carhart (1997),and Pastor and Stambaugh (2003), spurred interest in studying cross-sectionalreturn patterns. In the last nine years, the annual factor discovery rate hasincreased sharply to around 18. In total, 164 factors were discovered in the pastnine years, roughly doubling the 84 factors discovered in all previous years. Wedo not include working papers in Figure 2. In our sample, there are 63 workingpapers covering 68 factors.
We obtain t-statistics for each of the 316 factors discovered, including the
ones in the working papers.
26The overwhelming majority of t-statistics exceed
the 1.96 benchmark for 5% signiﬁcance.27The nonsigniﬁcant ones typically
belong to papers that propose a number of factors. These likely representonly a small subsample of nonsigniﬁcant t-statistics for all tried factors.
Importantly, we take published t-statistics as given. That is, we assume they are
econometrically sound with respect to the usual suspects (data errors, codingerrors, misalignment, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, clustering, outliers,etc.).
26The sign of a t-statistic depends on the direction of the long/short strategy. We usually calculate p-values based
on two-sided t-tests, so the sign does not matter. From an investment perspective, the sign of the mean return of
a long/short strategy does not matter as we can always reverse the direction of the strategy. Therefore we useabsolute values of these t-statistics.
27The multiple testing framework is robust to outliers. The procedures are based on either the total number of tests
(Bonferroni) or the order statistics of t-statistics (Holm and BHY).

3.6 p-value adjustment when all tests are published ( M=R)
We now apply the three adjustment methods previously introduced to the
observed factor tests, under the assumption that the test results of all triedfactors are available. We know that this assumption is false since our sampleunderrepresents all insigniﬁcant factors by conventional signiﬁcance standards:we only observe those insigniﬁcant factors that are the results of purposefulfalsiﬁcation experiments. We design methods to handle this missing dataissue later.
Despite some limitations, our results in this section are useful for at least
two reasons. First, the benchmark t-statistic based on our incomplete sample
provides a lower bound of the true t-statistic benchmark. In other words, if M
(total number of tests) >R (total number of discoveries), then we would expect
fewer factors than when M=R,
28so future t-statistics need to at least surpass
our benchmark to claim signiﬁcance. Second, results in this section can berationalized within a Bayesian or hierarchical testing framework.
29Factors in
our list constitute an “elite” group: they have survived academia’s scrutiny forpublication. Placing a high prior on this group in a Bayesian testing frameworkor viewing this group as a cluster in a hierarchical testing framework, onecan interpret results in this section as the ﬁrst-step factor selection within an apriori group.
Based on our sample of observed t-statistics of published factors,
30we obtain
three benchmark t-statistics. In particular, at each point in time, we transform
the set of available t-statistics into p-values. We then apply the three adjustment
methods to obtain benchmark p-values. Finally, these p-value benchmarks are
transformed back into t-statistics, assuming that standard normal distribution
approximates the t-distribution well. To guide future research, we extrapolate
our benchmark t-statistics into the future, assuming that the rate of “factor
production” remains the same as the recent history, that is, 2003–2012.
We choose to set αwat 5% (Holm, FWER) and αdat 1% (BHY , FDR)
for our main results. The signiﬁcance level is subjective, as in individualhypothesis testing, where conventional signiﬁcance levels are usually adopted.Since FWER is a special case of the type I error in individual testing and 5%seems the default signiﬁcance level in cross-sectional studies, we set α
wat
5%. On the other hand, FDR is a more lenient control relative to FWER. If wechoose the same α
dasαw, then by deﬁnition the BHY method will be more
lenient than both Holm and Bonferroni. We set FDR at 1% but will explainwhat happens when α
dis increased to 5%.
Figure 3 presents the three benchmark t-statistics. Both Bonferroni and Holm
adjusted benchmark t-statistics are monotonically increasing in the number
of discoveries. For Bonferroni, the benchmark t-statistic starts at 1.96 and
increases to 3.78 by 2012. It reaches 4.00 in 2032. The corresponding p-values

(under single tests) for 3.78 and 4.00 are 0.02% and 0.01%, respectively, much
lower than the starting level of 5%. Holm implied t-statistics always fall below
Bonferroni t-statistics, consistent with the fact that Bonferroni always results
in fewer discoveries than Holm. However, Holm tracks Bonferroni closelyand their differences are small. BHY implied benchmarks, on the other hand,are not monotonic. They ﬂuctuate before year 2000 and stabilize at 3.39 ( p-
value = 0.07%) after 2010. This stationarity feature of BHY implied t-statistics,
inherent in the deﬁnition of FDR, contrasts with that of Bonferroni and Holm.Intuitively, at any ﬁxed signiﬁcance level α, the law of large numbers forces
the false discovery rate (FDR) to converge to a constant. If we change α
dto
5%, the corresponding BHY implied benchmark t-statistic is 2.78 ( p-value =
0.54%) in 2012 and 2.81 (p-value = 0.50%) in 2032, still much higher thanthe starting value of 1.96. In sum, after taking testing multiplicity into account,we believe the minimum threshold t-statistic for 5% signiﬁcance is about 2.8,
which corresponds to a p-value (if a single test) of 0.5%.
To see how the new t-statistic benchmarks better reveal the statistical
signiﬁcance of factors, in Figure 3 we mark the t-statistics of a few prominent
factors.Among these factors, HML, MOM, DCG, SRV , and MRT are signiﬁcantacross all types of t-statistic adjustments, EP, LIQ, and CVOL are sometimes
signiﬁcant, and the rest are never signiﬁcant.
One concern with our results is that factors are discovered at different times
and tests are conducted using different methods. This heterogeneity in the timeof discovery and testing methods may blur the interpretation of our results.Ideally, we want updated factor tests that are based on the most recent sampleand the same testing method.
31To alleviate this concern, we focus on the
group of factors that are published no earlier than 2000 and rely on Fama-MacBeth tests. Additionally, we require that factor tests cover at least the1970–1995 period and have as controls at least the Fama-French three factors(Fama and French 1993). This leaves us with 124 factors. Based on this factorgroup, the Bonferroni and Holm implied threshold t-statistics are 3.54 and
3.20 (5% signiﬁcance), respectively, and the BHY implied thresholds are 3.23(1% signiﬁcance) and 2.67 (5% signiﬁcance) by 2012. Not surprisingly, thesestatistics are smaller than the corresponding thresholds based on the full sample.
will only rise if there are more factors. Holm and BHY depend on the exact t-statistic distribution, so more factors
do not necessarily imply a higher t-statistic benchmark.

testing. See Meinshausen (2008) for a hierarchical approach on variable selection.
30See the Online Appendix B for details on our sampling procedure.
31We want to stress that the three types of adjustments in our paper are robust to the heterogeneity in the time of
discovery and testing methods among individual studies. That is, despite the varying degrees of sample overlapand the differences in the testing methods, our adjustment procedures guarantee that the type I errors (howeverthey are deﬁned) are controlled under their prespeciﬁed levels. Therefore, from a technical point of view, neithernonsimultaneity nor differences in testing methods invalidate our results.

However, the general message that we need a much higher t-statistic threshold
when multiple testing is taken into account is unchanged.
3.7 Robustness
3.7.1 Test statistics dependence. There is a caveat for all three methods
considered so far. In the context of multiple testing, any type of adjustmentprocedure can become too stringent when there is a certain dependence structurein the data. This is because these procedures are primarily designed to guardagainst type I errors. Under a certain correlation structure, they may penalizetype I errors too harshly and lead to a high type II error rate.
In theory, under independence, Bonferroni and Holm approximately achieve
the prespeciﬁed signiﬁcance level αwhen the number of tests is large. On the
other hand, both procedures tend to generate fewer discoveries than desiredwhen there is a certain degree of dependence among the tests. Intuitively, inthe extreme case in which all tests are the same (i.e., correlation = 1.0), wedo not need to adjust at all: FWER is the same as the type I error rate forsingle tests. Hence, the usual single hypothesis test is sufﬁcient. Similarly,BHY may generate too few discoveries when tests are independent or positivelycorrelated.
Having discussed assumptions for the testing methods to work efﬁciently,
we now try to think of scenarios that can potentially violate these assumptions.First, factors that proxy for the same type of risk may be dependent. Moreover,returns of long-short portfolios designed to achieve exposure to a particulartype of factor may be correlated. For example, there are a number of factorswith price in the denominator that are naturally correlated. We also count fourdifferent idiosyncratic volatility factors. If this type of positive dependenceexists among test statistics, all three methods would likely generate fewersigniﬁcant factors than desired. On the other hand, most often factors need to“stand their ground” to be published. In the end, if you think we are overcountingat 316, consider taking a haircut to 113 factors (the number of “common” factorsin Table 1). Figure 3 shows that our main conclusions do not materially change.For example, the Holm at 113 factors is 3.29 ( p-value = 0.10%), while Holm
at 316 factors is 3.64 ( p-value = 0.03%).
Second, research studying the same factor but based on different samples
will generate highly dependent test statistics. Examples include the sequenceof papers studying the size effect. We try to minimize this concern by including,with a few exceptions, only the original paper that proposes the factor. To theextent that our list includes few such duplicate factors, our method greatlyreduces the dependence that would be introduced by including all papersstudying the same factor but for different sample periods.
Finally, when dependence among test statistics can be captured by Pearson
correlations among contemporaneous strategy returns, we present a new modelin Section 5 to systematically incorporate the information in test correlations.

3.7.2 The case in which M>R .To deal with the hidden tests issue when
M>R , we propose in Appendix A a simulation framework to estimate
benchmark t-statistics. The idea is to ﬁrst back out the underlying distribution
for the t-statistics of all tried factors, then to generate benchmark t-statistic
estimates, and apply the three adjustment procedures to simulated t-statistics
samples.32
Based on our estimates, 71% of all tried factors are missing. Using this
information, the new benchmark t-statistics for Bonferroni and Holm are
estimated to be 4.01 and 3.96, respectively, both slightly higher than whenM=R. This is as expected because more factors are tried under this framework.
The BHY implied t-statistic increases from 3.39 to 3.68 at 1% signiﬁcance
and from 2.78 to 3.18 at 5% signiﬁcance. In sum, across various scenarios,we think the minimum threshold t-statistic is 3.18, corresponding to BHY’s
adjustment for M>R at 5% signiﬁcance. Alternative cases all result in even
higher benchmark t-statistics.
One concern with BHY is that our speciﬁcation of c(M) results in an overly
stringent threshold for FDR. We therefore try the more lenient choice (i.e.,c(M)≡1) as in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). Based on our estimate that
71% of tried factors are missing and by simulating the missing tests as in
Appendix A, we ﬁnd that the BHY implied threshold equals 3.05 at 5%
signiﬁcance and 3.17 at 1% signiﬁcance. Indeed, these numbers are smallerthan the numbers under our default speciﬁcation of c(M) (i.e., c(M)=/summationtext
M
j=11
j).
However, they are above 3.0 and therefore are consistent with our overallmessage.
3.7.3A Bayesian hypothesis testing framework. We can also study multiple
hypothesis testing within a Bayesian framework. One major obstacle ofapplying Bayesian methods in our context is the unobservability of all triedfactors. While we propose new frequentist methods to handle this missing dataproblem, it is not clear how to structure the Bayesian framework in this context.In addition, the high dimensionality of the problem raises concerns on both theaccuracy and the computational burden of Bayesian methods.
Nevertheless, ignoring the missing data issue, we outline a standard Bayesian
multiple hypothesis testing framework in Appendix B and explain how itrelates to our multiple testing framework. We discuss in detail the pros andcons of the Bayesian approach. In contrast to the frequentist approach, whichuses generalized type I error rates to guide multiple testing, the Bayesianapproach relies on the posterior likelihood function and thus contains a naturalpenalty term for multiplicity. However, this simplicity comes at the expense ofhaving a restrictive hierarchical model structure and independence assumptions
32The underlying assumption for the model in Appendix A is the independence among t-statistics, which may not
be plausible given our previous discussions on test dependence. In that case, our structural model in Section 5proposes a more realistic data generating process for the cross-section of test statistics.

that may not be realistic for our factor testing problem. Although extensions
incorporating certain forms of dependence are possible, it is unclear whatprecisely we should do for the 316 factors in our list. In addition, even for theBayesian approach, the ﬁnal reject/accept decision still involves the thresholdchoice. Due to these concerns, we choose not to implement the Bayesianapproach. We leave extensions of the basic Bayesian framework that couldpossibly alleviate the above concerns to future research.
3.7.4 Methods controlling the FDP. Instead of FDR, recent research by
Lehmann and Romano (2005) develops methods to directly control the realizedFDP. In particular, they propose a step-down method to control for theprobability of FDP exceeding a threshold value. Since their deﬁnition of type Ierror (i.e., P(FDP>γ ), where γis the threshold FDP value) is different from
either FWER or FDR, results based on their methods are not comparable toours. However, the main conclusion is the same. For instance, when γ=0.10
andα=0.05, the benchmark t-statistic is 2.70 ( p-value = 0.69%), which is
much higher than the conventional cutoff of 1.96. Details are presented inOnline Appendix C.
4. Correlation among Test Statistics
Although the BHY method is robust to arbitrary dependence among test
statistics, it does not use any information about the dependence structure. Suchinformation, when appropriately incorporated, can be helpful in making themethod more accurate (i.e., less stringent). We focus on the type of dependencethat can be captured by the Pearson correlation. To generate correlation amongtest statistics, we focus on the correlation among factor returns. This correlationis likely driven by macroeconomic and market-wide variables. Therefore, inour context, the dependence among test statistics is equivalent to the correlationamong factor returns.
Multiple testing corrections in the presence of correlation have been only
considered in the recent statistics literature. Existing methods include bootstrap-based permutation tests and direct statistical modeling. Permutation testsresample the entire dataset and construct an empirical distribution for the poolof test statistics.
33Through resampling, the correlation structure in the data
is taken into account and no model is needed. In contrast, direct statisticalmodeling makes additional distributional assumptions on the data-generatingprocess. These assumptions are usually case dependent as different kinds ofcorrelations are more plausible under different circumstances.
34
33Westfall (1993) and Ge et al. (2003) are the early papers that suggest the permutation resampling approach
in multiple testing. Later development of the permutation approach tries to reduce computational burden byproposing efﬁcient alternative approaches. Examples include Lin (2005), Conneely and Boehnke (2007), andHan, Kang, and Eskin (2009).
34See Sun and Cai (2009) and Wei et al. (2009).

In addition, recent research in ﬁnance explores bootstrap procedures to assess
the statistical signiﬁcance of individual tests.35Many of these studies focus
on performance evaluation and test whether fund managers exhibit skill. Ourapproach focuses on the joint distribution of the test statistics (both FWER andFDR depend on the cross-section of t-statistics) and evaluates the signiﬁcance
of each individual factor.
Unfortunately, we do not always observe the time series of factor returns
(when a t-statistic is based on long-short strategy returns) or the time series
of slopes in cross-sectional regressions (when a t-statistic is based on the
slope coefﬁcients in cross-sectional regressions). Because few researchers posttheir original data, often all we have is the single t-statistic that summarizes
the signiﬁcance of a factor. We propose a novel approach to overcome thismissing data problem. It is in essence a “direct modeling approach” but does notrequire the full information of the return series based on which the t-statistic is
constructed. In addition, our approach is ﬂexible enough to incorporate variouskinds of distributional assumptions. We expect it to be a valuable addition to themultiple testing literature, especially when only test statistics are observable.
4.1 A model with correlations
For each factor, suppose researchers construct a corresponding long-short
trading strategy and normalize the return standard deviation to be σ=15% per
year, which is close to the annual volatility of the market index.
36In particular,
let the normalized strategy return in period tfor the i-th discovered strategy be
Xi,t. Then the t-statistic for testing the signiﬁcance of this strategy is:
Ti=(N/summationdisplay
t=1Xi,t/N)/(σ/√
N).
Assuming joint normality and zero serial correlation for strategy returns, this
t-statistic has a normal distribution
Ti∼N(μi/(σ/√
N),1),
where μidenotes the population mean of the strategy. The μi’s are
unobservable, and hypothesis testing under this framework amounts to testingμ
i>0. We assume that each μiis an independent draw from the following
mixture distribution:
μi∼p0I{μ=0}+(1−p0)Exp(λ),
where I{μ=0}is the distribution that has a point mass at zero, Exp( λ)i st h e
exponential distribution that has a mean parameter λ, andp0is the probability of
35See Efron (1979) for the original work in the statistics literature. For recent ﬁnance applications, see Karolyi
and Kho (2004), Kosowski et al. (2006), Kosowski, Naik, and Teo (2007), Fama and French (2010), Cao et al.(2013), and Harvey and Liu (2014c).
36Notice that this assumption is not necessary for our approach. Fixing the standard deviations of different strategieseliminates the need to separately model them, which can be done through a joint modeling of the mean andvariance of the cross-section of returns. See Harvey and Liu (2014a) for further discussions on this.

drawing from the point mass distribution. This mixture distribution assumption
is the core component for Bayesian multiple testing and succinctly capturesthe idea of hypothesis testing in the traditional frequentist’s view: while thereis a range of possible values for the means of truly proﬁtable strategies, aproportion of strategies should have a mean that is indistinguishable from zero.
The exponential assumption is not essential for our model as more sophisticated
distributions (e.g., a Gamma distribution featuring two free parameters) canbe used. We use the exponential distribution for its simplicity
37and, perhaps
more importantly, because it is consistent with the intuition that more proﬁtablestrategies are less likely to exist. An exponential distribution captures thisfeature by having a monotonically decreasing probability density function.
Next, we incorporate correlations into the above framework. Among
the various sources of correlations, the cross-sectional correlations amongcontemporaneous returns are the most important for us to take into account.
These correlations are likely induced by a response to common macroeconomic
or market shocks. Other kinds of correlations can be easily embedded into ourframework as well.
38
As a starting point, we assume that the contemporaneous correlation between
two strategies’ returns is ρ. The noncontemporaneous correlations are assumed
to be zero. That is,
Corr(Xi,t,Xj,t)=ρ, i/negationslash=j,
Corr(Xi,t,Xj,s)=0,t/negationslash=s.
Finally, to incorporate the impact of hidden tests, we assume that M
factors are tried, but only factors that exceed a certain t-statistic threshold are
published. We set the threshold t-statistic at 1.96 and focus on the subsample
of factors that have a t-statistic larger than 1.96. However, as shown in
Appendix A, factors with marginal t-statistics (i.e., t-statistics just above 1.96)
are less likely to be published than those with larger t-statistics. Therefore,
our subsample of published t-statistics only covers a fraction of t-statistics
above 1.96 for tried factors. To overcome this missing data problem, weassume that our sample covers a fraction roft-statistics in between 1.96
and 2.57 and that all t-statistics above 2.57 are covered. We augment the
existing t-statistic sample to construct the full sample. For instance, when
r=1/2, we simply duplicate the sample of t-statistics in between 1.96 and
2.57 and maintain the sample of t-statistics above 2.57 to construct the full
37As shown later, we need to estimate the parameters in the mixture model based on our t-statistics sample. An
overparameterized distribution for the continuous distribution in the mixture model, albeit ﬂexible, may resultin imprecise estimates. We therefore use the simple one-parameter exponential distribution family.
38To incorporate the serial correlation for individual strategies, we can model them as simple autoregressive
processes. See Harvey and Liu (2014a) for further discussion of the kinds of correlation structures that our modelis able to incorporate. See Sun and Cai (2009) for an example that models the spatial dependence among the nullhypotheses.

sample. For the baseline case, we set r=1/2, consistent with the analysis
in Appendix A. We try alternative values of rto determine how the results
change.39
Given the correlation structure and the sampling distribution for the means
of returns, we can fully characterize the distributional properties of the cross-section of returns. We can also determine the distribution for the cross-sectionoft-statistics as they are functions of returns. Based on our sample of t-statistics
for published research, we match key sample statistics with their populationcounterparts in the model.
The sample statistics we choose to match are the quantiles of the sample
oft-statistics and the sample size (i.e., the total number of discoveries).
Two concerns motivate us to use quantiles. First, sample quantiles are less
susceptible to outliers compared to means and other moment-related samplestatistics. Our t-statistic sample does have a few inﬂuential observations, and
we expect quantiles to be more useful descriptive statistics than the mean andthe standard deviation. Second, simulation studies show that quantiles in ourmodel are more sensitive to changes in parameters than other statistics. To offera more efﬁcient estimation of the model, we choose to focus on quantiles.
In particular, the quantities we choose to match and their values for the
baseline sample (i.e., r=1/2) are given by:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩/hatwideT=Total number of discoveries=353 ,
/hatwideQ
1=The 20th percentile of the sample of t-statistics=2 .39,
/hatwideQ2=The 50th percentile of the sample of t-statistics=3 .16,
/hatwideQ3=The 90th percentile of the sample of t-statistics=6 .34.
These three quantiles are representative of the spectrum of quantiles and can be
shown to be most sensitive to parameter changes in our model. Fixing the modelparameters, we can also obtain the model implied sample statistics T,Q
1,Q2,
andQ3through simulations.40The estimation works by seeking to ﬁnd the set
of parameters that minimizes the following objective function:
D(λ,p 0,M,ρ )=w0(T−/hatwideT)2+3/summationdisplay
i=1wi(Qi−/hatwideQi)2,
where w0and{wi}3
i=1are the weights associated with the squared distances.
Motivated by the optimal weighting for the generalized method of moments(GMM) estimators, we set these weights at w
0=1 and w1=w2=w3=10,000.
39Our choice of the threshold t-statistic is smaller than the 2.57 threshold in Appendix A. This allows us to observe
false discoveries that overcome the threshold more frequently than under 2.57. This is important for the estimationof
p0in the model. For more details on the selection of the threshold t-statistic, see Harvey and Liu (2014a).
40Model implied quantiles are difﬁcult (and most likely infeasible) to calculate analytically. We obtain them through
simulations. In particular, for a ﬁxed set of parameters, we simulate 5,000 independent samples of t-statistics.
For each sample, we calculate the four summary statistics. The median of these summary statistics across the5,000 simulations is taken as the model implied statistics.

… and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns
They can be shown to have the same magnitude as the inverses of the variances
of the corresponding model implied sample statistics across a wide range ofparameter values and should help improve estimation efﬁciency.
41
We estimate the three parameters ( λ,p 0, andM) in the model and choose
to calibrate the correlation coefﬁcient ρ. In particular, for a given level of
correlation ρ, we numerically search for the model parameters ( λ,p 0,M) that
minimize the objective function D(λ,p 0,M,ρ ).
We choose to calibrate the amount of correlation because the correlation
coefﬁcient is likely to be weakly identiﬁed in this framework. Ideally, tohave a better identiﬁcation of ρ, we would like to have t-statistics that are
generated from samples that have varying degrees of overlap.
42We do not
allow heterogeneity in sample periods in either our estimation framework (i.e.,allt-statistics are generated from samples that cover the same period) or our
data (we do not record the speciﬁc period for which the t-statistic is generated).
As a result, our results are best interpreted as the estimated t-statistic thresholds
for a hypothetical level of correlation.
To investigate how correlation affects multiple testing, we follow an intuitive
simulation procedure. In particular, ﬁxing λ,p
0, andMat their estimates, we
know the data-generating process for the cross-section of returns. Throughsimulations, we are able to calculate the previously deﬁned type I error rates(i.e., FWER and FDR) for any given threshold t-statistic. We search for the
optimal threshold t-statistic that exactly achieves a prespeciﬁed error rate.
4.2 Results
Our estimation framework assumes a balanced panel with Mfactors and N
periods of returns. We need to assign a value to N. Published papers usually
cover a period ranging from twenty to ﬁfty years. In our framework, thechoice of Ndoes not affect the distribution of T
iunder the null hypothesis
(i.e.,μi=0) but will affect Tiunder the alternative hypothesis (i.e., μi>0).
When μiis different from zero, Tihas a mean of μi/(σ/√
N). A larger N
reduces the noise in returns and makes it more likely for Tito be signiﬁcant.
To be conservative (i.e., less likely to generate signiﬁcant t-statistics under the
alternative hypotheses), we set Nat 240 (i.e., twenty years). Other speciﬁcations
ofNchange the estimate of λbut leave the other parameters almost intact. In
particular, the threshold t-statistics are little changed for alternative values of N.
The results are presented in Table 5. Across different correlation levels, λ
(the mean parameter for the exponential distribution that represents the mean
41We do not pursue a likelihood-based estimation. Given that we have more than a thousand factors and each of
them is associated with an indicator variable that is missing, the likelihood function involves high-dimensionalintegrals and is difﬁcult to optimize. This leads us to a GMM-based approach.
42Intuitively, t-statistics that are based on similar sample periods are more correlated than t-statistics that are
based on distinct sample periods. Therefore, the degree of overlap in sample period helps identify the correlationcoefﬁcient. See Ferson and Chen (2013) for a similar argument on measuring the correlations among fund returns.

corresponds to an annual factor return of 6.6%. Therefore, we estimate theaverage mean returns for truly signiﬁcant factors to be 6.6% per annum. Giventhat we standardize factor returns by an annual volatility of 15%, the averageannual Sharpe ratio for these factors is 0.44 (or monthly Sharpe ratio of 0.13).

Focusing on the baseline case in panel A and at ρ=0, we estimate that

Turning to the estimates of threshold t-statistics and focusing on FWER,
we see that they are not monotonic in the level of correlation. Intuitively, twoforces are at work in driving these threshold t-statistics. On the one hand, both

both in absolute value and in proportion—are drawn from the null hypothesis.
To control the occurrences of false discoveries based on these factors, we need
a higher threshold t-statistic. On the other hand, a higher correlation among
test statistics reduces the required threshold t-statistic. In the extreme case
when all test statistics are perfectly correlated, we do not need multiple testingadjustment at all. These two forces work against each other and result in thenonmonotonic pattern for the threshold t-statistics under FWER. For FDR,
43Our estimates are robust to the sample percentiles that we choose to match. For instance, ﬁxing the level of
correlation at 0.2, when we use the 10th together with the 50th and 90th percentiles of the sample of t-statistics,
our parameter estimate is (p0,λ,M )=(0.390,0.548,1,287). Alternatively, when we use the 80th together with the
20th and 50th percentiles of the sample of t-statistics, our parameter estimate is (p0,λ,M )=(0.514,0.579,1,493).
Both estimates are in the neighborhood of our baseline model estimates.

it appears that the impact of larger p0andMdominates so that the threshold
t-statistics are increasing in the level of correlation.
Across various correlation speciﬁcations, our estimates show that in general
at-statistic of 3.9 and 3.0 is needed to control FWER at 5% and FDR at 1%,
respectively.44Notice that these numbers are not far away from our previous
estimates of 3.78 (Holm adjustment that controls FWER at 5%) and 3.38 (BHYadjustment that controls FDR at 1%). However, these similar numbers aregenerated through different mechanisms. Our current estimate assumes a certainlevel of correlation among returns and relies on an estimate of more than 1,300for the total number of factor tests. On the other hand, our previous calculationassumes that the 316 published factors are all the factors that have been triedbut does not specify a correlation structure.
4.3 How large is ρ?
Our sample has limitations in making a direct inference on the level of
correlation. To give some guidance, we provide indirect evidence on theplausible levels of ρ.
First, the value of the optimized objective function sheds light on the level
ofρ. Intuitively, a value of ρthat is more consistent with the data-generating
process should result in a lower optimized objective function.Across the variousspeciﬁcations of ρin Table 5, we ﬁnd that the optimized objective function
reaches its lowest point when ρ=0.2. Therefore, our t-statistic sample suggests
a low level of correlation. However, this evidence is only suggestive given theweak identiﬁcation of ρin our model.
Second, we draw on external data source to provide inference. In
particular, we analyze the S&P CAPITAL IQ database, which includes detailedinformation on the time-series of returns of over 400 factors for the U.S. equitymarket. We estimate the average pairwise correlation among these factors tobe 0.15 for the 1985–2014 period.
Finally, existing studies in the literature provide guidance on the level of
correlation. McLean and Pontiff (2015) estimate the correlation among anomalyreturns to be around 0.05. Green, Hand, and Zhang (2013a) focus on accounting-based factors and ﬁnd the average correlation to be between 0.06 and 0.20.Focusing on mutual fund returns, Barras, Scaillet, and Wermers (2010) argue fora correlation of zero among fund returns (i.e., excess returns against benchmarkfactors), while Ferson and Chen (2013) calibrate this number to be between 0.04and 0.09.
Overall, we believe that the average correlation among factor returns is in
the neighborhood of 0.20.
44To save space, we choose not to discuss the performance of our estimation method. Harvey and Liu (2014a)
provide a detailed simulation study of our model.

4.4 How many true factors are there?
The number of true discoveries using our method seems high given that most
of us believe as a priori that there are only a handful of true systematic riskfactors. However, many of these factors that our method deems statisticallytrue have tiny Sharpe ratios. For example, around 70% of them have a Sharperatio that is less than 0.5 per annum. From a modeling perspective, we imposea monotonic exponential density for the mean returns of true factors. Hence, byassumption, the number of discoveries will be decreasing in the mean return.
Overall, statistical evidence can only get us so far in reducing the number
of false discoveries. This is a limitation not only to our framework but alsoprobably in any statistical framework that relies on individual p-values. To see
this, suppose the smallest t-statistic among true risk factors is 3.0 and assume
our sample covers ﬁfty risk factors that all have a t-statistic above 3.0. Then
based on statistical evidence only, it is impossible to rule out any of these ﬁftyfactors from the list of true risk factors.
We agree that a further scrutiny of the factor universe is a valuable exercise.
There are at least two routes we can take. One route is to introduce additional
testable assumptions that a systematic risk factor has to satisfy to claimsigniﬁcance. Pukthuanthong and Roll (2014) use the principle componentsof the cross-section of realized returns to impose such assumptions. The otherroute is to incrementally increase the factor list by allowing different factors tocrowd each other out. Harvey and Liu (2014c) provide such a framework. Weexpect both lines of research to help in culling the number of factors.
5. Conclusion
At least 316 factors have been tested to explain the cross-section of expected
returns. Most of these factors have been proposed over the last ten years. Indeed,Cochrane (2011) refers to this as “a zoo of new factors.” Our paper argues thatit is a serious mistake to use the usual statistical signiﬁcance cutoffs (e.g., at-statistic exceeding 2.0) in asset pricing tests. Given the plethora of factors, and
the inevitable data mining, many of the historically discovered factors wouldbe deemed “signiﬁcant” by chance.
There is an important philosophical issue embedded in our approach. Our
threshold cutoffs increase through time as more factors are data mined.However, data mining is not new. Why should we have a higher thresholdfor today’s data mining than for data mining in the 1980s? We believe there arethree reasons for tougher criteria today. First, the low-hanging fruit has alreadybeen picked. That is, the rate of discovering a true factor has likely decreased.Second, there is a limited amount of data. Indeed, there is only so much youcan do with the CRSP database. In contrast, in particle physics, it is routineto create trillions of new observations in an experiment. We do not have thatluxury in ﬁnance. Third, the cost of data mining has dramatically decreased.In the past, data collection and estimation were time intensive, so it was more

… and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns
likely that only factors with the highest priors—potentially based on economic
ﬁrst principles—were tried.
Our paper presents three conventional multiple testing frameworks and
proposes a new one that particularly suits research in ﬁnancial economics.
While these frameworks differ in their assumptions, they are consistent in their
conclusions. We argue that a newly discovered factor today should have at-statistic that exceeds 3.0. We provide a time-series of recommended “cutoffs”
from the ﬁrst empirical test in 1967 through to present day. Many publishedfactors fail to exceed our recommended cutoffs.
While a t-statistic of 3.0 (which corresponds to a p-value of 0.27%) seems
like a very high hurdle, we also argue that there are good reasons to expectthat 3.0 is too low. First, we only count factors that are published in prominentjournals and we sample only a small fraction of the working papers. Second,there are surely many factors that were tried by empiricists, failed, and nevermade it to publication or even a working paper. Indeed, the culture in ﬁnancialeconomics is to focus on the discovery of new factors. In contrast with otherﬁelds, such as medical science, it is rare to publish replication studies focusingon only existing factors. Given that our count of 316 tested factors is surely toolow, this means the t-statistic cutoff is likely even higher.
45
Should a t-statistic of 3.0 be used for every factor proposed in the future?
Probably not. A case can be made that a factor developed from ﬁrst principlesshould have a lower threshold t-statistic than a factor that is discovered as
a purely empirical exercise. Nevertheless, a t-statistic of 2.0 is no longer
appropriate—even for factors that are derived from theory.
In medical research, the recognition of the multiple testing problem has
led to the disturbing conclusion that “most claimed research ﬁndings arefalse” (Ioannidis (2005)). Our analysis of factor discoveries leads to the sameconclusion – many of the factors discovered in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance are likely falsediscoveries: of the 296 published signiﬁcant factors, 158 would be consideredfalse discoveries under Bonferonni, 142 under Holm, 132 under BHY (1%),and 80 under BHY (5%). In addition, the idea that there are so many factors isinconsistent with the principal component analysis, where, perhaps there areﬁve “statistical” common factors driving time-series variation in equity returns(Ahn, Horenstein, and Wang 2012).
The assumption that researchers follow the rules of classical statistics
(e.g., randomization, unbiased reporting) is at odds with the notion ofindividual incentives, ironically, one of the fundamental premises in economics.Importantly, the optimal amount of data mining is not zero since some datamining produces knowledge. The key, as argued by Glaeser (2008), is to designappropriate statistical methods to adjust for biases, not to eliminate research
45In astronomy and physics, even higher threshold t-statistics are often used to control for testing multiplicity. For
instance, the high proﬁle discovery of Higgs Boson has a t-statistic of more than 5 ( p-value less than 0.0001%).

initiatives. The multiple testing framework detailed in our paper is true to this
advice.
Our research quantiﬁes the warnings of both Fama (1991) and Schwert
(2003). We attempt to navigate the zoo and establish new benchmarks to guideempirical asset pricing tests.
Appendix A Multiple Testing When the Number of Tests ( M) Is Unknown
The empirical difﬁculty in applying standard p-value adjustments is that we do not observe factors
that have been tried, found to be insigniﬁcant and then discarded. We attempt to overcome thisdifﬁculty using a simulation framework. The idea is ﬁrst to simulate the empirical distribution ofp-values for all experiments (published and unpublished) and then to adjust the p-values based on
these simulated samples.
First, we assume the test statistic ( t-statistic, for instance) for any experiment follows a certain
distribution D(e.g., exponential distribution) and the set of published works is a truncated D
distribution. Based on the estimation framework for truncated distributions,
46we estimate the
parameters of distribution Dand the total number of trials M. Next, we simulate many sequences
ofp-values, each corresponding to a plausible set of p-value realizations of all trials. To account for
the uncertainty in parameter estimates of DandM, we simulate the p-value sequences based on
the distribution of estimated DandM. Finally, for each p-value, we calculate the adjusted p-value
based on a sequence of simulated p-values. The median is taken as the ﬁnal adjusted p-value.
A.1 Using Truncated Exponential Distribution to Model the t-statistic Sample
Truncated distributions have been used to study hidden tests (i.e., publication bias) in medical
research.47The idea is that studies reporting signiﬁcant results are more likely to get published.
Assuming a threshold signiﬁcance level or t-statistic, researchers can, to some extent, infer the
results of unpublished works and gain an understanding of the overall effect of a drug or treatment.However, in medical research, insigniﬁcant results are still viewed as an indispensable part of theoverall statistical evidence and are given much more prominence than in the ﬁnancial economicsresearch.As a result, medical publications are more likely to report insigniﬁcant results. This makesapplying the truncated distribution framework to medical studies difﬁcult as there is no clear-cutthreshold value.
48In this sense, the truncated distributional framework suits our study better—1.96
is the obvious hurdle that research needs to overcome to be published.
On the other hand, not all tried factors with a t-statistic above 1.96 are reported. In the
quantitative asset management industry, signiﬁcant results are not published—they are considered“trade secrets.” For the academic literature, factors with “borderline” t-statistics are difﬁcult to
get published. Thus, our sample is likely missing a number of factors that have t-statistics just
over 1.96. To make our inference robust, for our baseline result, we assume all tried factors witht-statistics above 2.57 are observed and ignore those with t-statistics in the range of (1.96, 2.57).
We experiment with alternative ways to handle t-statistics in this range.
Many distributions can be used to model the t-statistic sample. One restriction that we think
any of these distributions should satisfy is the monotonicity of the density curve. Intuitively, itshould be easier to ﬁnd factors with small t-statistics than with large ones.
49We choose to use the
simplest distribution that incorporates this monotonicity condition: the exponential distribution.
46See Heckman (1979) and Greene (2008), Chapter 24).
47See Begg and Berlin (1988) and Thornton and Lee (2000).
48When the threshold value is unknown, it must be estimated from the likelihood function. However, such estimation
usually incurs large estimation errors.
49This basic scarcity assumption is also the key ingredient in our model in Section 5.

t-statistics above 1.96. Panel C is based on the augmented sample that adds the subsample of observations that
fall in between 1.96 and 2.57 to the original t-statistic sample. It doubles the number of observations within the
range of 1.96 and 2.57 in the original sample.

Panel A of Figure A.1 presents the histogram of the baseline t-statistic sample and the ﬁtted

mean of 2.07.51Panel B is a histogram of the original t-statistic sample, which, as we discussed
before, is likely to underrepresent the sample with a t-statistic in the range of (1.96, 2.57). Panel C
is the augmented t-statistic sample with the ad hoc assumption that our sample covers only half of
all factors with t-statistics between 1.96 and 2.57. The population mean estimate is 2.22 in panel
50There are a few very large t-statistics in our sample. We ﬁt the truncated exponential model without dropping any
large t-statistics. In contrast to the usual normal density, exponential distribution is better at modeling extreme
observations. In addition, extreme values are pivotal statistics for heavy-tailed distributions and are key for modelestimation. While extreme observations are included for model estimation, we exclude them in Figure A.1 tobetter focus on the main part of the t-statistic range.
51Our truncated exponential distribution framework allows a simple analytical estimate for the population mean
of the exponential distribution. In particular, let c be the truncation point and the t-statistic sample be {ti}N
i=1.
The mean estimate is given by ˆλ=1/(¯t−c), where ¯t=(/summationtextN
i=1ti)/Nis the sample mean.

B and 1.93 in panel C. As expected, the underrepresentation of relatively small t-statistics results
in a higher mean estimate for the t-statistic population. We think the baseline model is the best
among all three models as it not only overcomes the missing data problem for the original sample,but also avoids guessing the fraction of missing observations in the 1.96–2.57 range. We use thosemodel estimates for the follow-up analysis.
Using the baseline model, we calculate other interesting population characteristics that are key
to multiple hypothesis testing. Assuming independence, we model observed t-statistics as draws
from an exponential distribution with mean parameter ˆλand a known cutoff point of 2.57. The
proportion of unobserved factors is then estimated as
P(unobserved)= /Phi1(2.57;ˆλ)=1−exp(−2.57/ˆλ)=71.1%, (A.1)
where /Phi1(c;λ) is the cumulative distribution function evaluated at cfor a exponential distribution
with mean λ. Our estimates indicate that the mean absolute value of the t-statistic for the underlying
factor population is 2.07 and about 71.1% of tried factors are discarded. Given that 238 out of theoriginal 316 factors have a t-statistic exceeding 2.57, the total number of factor tests is estimated
to be 824 (=238 /(1−71.1%)) and the number of factors with a t-statistic between 1.96 and 2.57
is estimated to be 82.
52Since our t-statistic sample covers only 57 such factors, roughly 30%
(=(82-57)/82) of t-statistics between 1.96 and 2.57 are hidden.
A.2 Simulated Benchmark t-statistics under Independence
The truncated exponential distribution framework helps us approximate the distribution of
t-statistics for all factors, both published and unpublished. We can then apply the aforementioned
adjustment techniques to this distribution to generate new t-statistic benchmarks. However, there
are two sources of sampling and estimation uncertainty that affect our results. First, our t-statistic
sample may underrepresent all factors with t-statistics exceeding 2.57.53Hence, our estimates of the
total trials are biased (too low), which affects our calculation of the benchmarks. Second, estimationerrors in the truncated exponential distribution can affect our benchmark t-statistics. Although we
can approximate the estimation error through the usual asymptotic distribution theory for MLE, itis unclear how this error affects our benchmark t-statistics. This is because t-statistic adjustment
procedures usually depend on the entire t-statistic distribution and so standard transformational
techniques (e.g., the delta method) do not apply. Moreover, we are not sure whether our sample islarge enough to trust the accuracy of asymptotic approximations.
Given these concerns, we propose a four-step simulation framework that incorporates these
uncertainties.
Step I Estimate λandMbased on a new t-statistic sample with size r×R.
Suppose our current t-statistic sample size is Rand it only covers a fraction of 1 /rof
all factors. We sample r×Rt-statistics (with replacement) from the original t-statistic
sample. Based on this new t-statistic sample, we apply the above truncated exponential
distribution framework to the t-statistics and obtain the parameter estimates λfor the
exponential distribution. The truncation probability is calculated as ˆP=/Phi1(2.57;ˆλ). We can
then estimate the total number of trials by
ˆM=rR
1−ˆP.
52Directly applying our estimate framework to the original sample that includes all t-statistics above 1.96, the
estimated total number of factor tests would be 713. Alternatively, assuming our sample only covers half of thefactors with t-statistics between 1.96 and 2.57, the estimated number of factors is 971.
53This will happen if we miss factors published by the academic literature or we do not have access to the “trade
secrets” by industry practitioners.

exponential distribution framework. Our estimation is based on the original t-statistic sample truncated at 2.57.
The sampling ratio is the assumed ratio of the true population size of t-statistics exceeding 2.57 over our current
sample size. Both Bonferroni and Holm have a signiﬁcance level of 5%.
Step II Calculate the benchmark t-statistic based on a random sample generated from ˆλ
andˆM.
Based on the previous step estimate of ˆλandˆM, we generate a random sample of t-statistics
for all tried factors. We then calculate the appropriate benchmark t-statistic based on this
generated sample.
Step III Repeat Step II 10,000 times to obtain the median benchmark t-statistic.
We take the median as the ﬁnal benchmark t-statistic corresponding to the parameter
estimate ( ˆλ,ˆM).
Step IV Repeat Steps I-III 10,000 times to generate a distribution of benchmark t-statistics.
Repeat Steps I-III 10,000 times, each time with a newly generated t-statistic sample as
in Step I. For each repetition, we obtain a benchmark t-statistic ticorresponding to the
parameter estimates ( ˆλi,ˆMi). In the end, we have a collection of benchmark t-statistics
{ti}10000
i=1.
To see how our procedure works, notice that Steps II and III calculate the theoretical benchmark
t-statistic for a t-statistic distribution characterized by ( ˆλ,ˆM). As a result, the outcome is simply
one number and there is no uncertainty around it. Uncertainties are incorporated in Steps I and IV .In particular, by repeatedly sampling from the original t-statistic sample and re-estimating λand
Meach time, we take into account the estimation error of the truncated exponential distribution.
Also, under the assumption that neglected signiﬁcant t-statistics follow the empirical distribution
of our t-statistic sample, by varying r, we can assess how this underrepresentation of our t-statistic
sample affects results.
Table A.1 shows estimates of Mand benchmark t-statistics. When r=1, the median estimate
for the total number of trials is 817,
54almost the same as our previous estimate of 820 based on
the original sample. Unsurprisingly, the Bonferroni implied benchmark t-statistic (4.01) is larger
than 3.78, which is what we obtain when ignoring unpublished works. The Holm implied t-statistic
(3.96), while not necessarily increasing in the number of trials, is also higher than before (3.64).
The BHY implied t-statistic increases from 3.39 to 3.68 at 1% signiﬁcance and from 2.78 to 3.18
at 5% signiﬁcance. As rincreases, the sample size Mand the benchmark t-statistics for all four
54Our previous estimate of 820 is a one-shot estimate based on the truncated sample. The results in Table A.1 are
based on repeated estimates based on resampled data: we resample many times, and 817 is the median of allthese estimates. It is close to the one-shot estimate.

types of adjustments increase. When rdoubles, the estimate of Malso approximately doubles
and the Bonferroni and Holm implied t-statistics increase by about 0.2, whereas the BHY implied
t-statistics increase by around 0.03 (under both signiﬁcance levels).
Appendix B A Bayesian Approach to Multiple Tests
The following framework is adopted from Scott and Berger (2006) and highlights the key issues
in Bayesian multiple hypothesis testing.55More sophisticated generalizations modify the basic
model but are unlikely to change the fundamental hierarchical testing structure.56We use this
framework to explain the pros and cons of performing multiple testing in a Bayesian framework.
The hierarchical model is as follows:
H1. (Xi|μi,σ2,γi)iid∼N(γiμi,σ2),
H2.μi|τ2iid∼N(0,τ2),γi|p0iid∼Ber(1−p0),
H3. (τ2,σ2)∼π1(τ2,σ2),p0∼π2(p0).
We explain each step and the notation in detail
H1.Xidenotes the average return generated from a long-short trading strategy based on a certain
factor; μiis the unknown mean return; σ2is the common variance for returns; and γiis
an indicator function, with γi=0 indicating a zero factor mean. γiis the counterpart of the
reject/accept decision in the usual (frequentists’) hypothesis testing framework.
H1 therefore says that factor returns are independent conditional on mean γiμiand
common variance σ2, with γi=0 indicating that the factor is spurious. The common
variance assumption may look restrictive, but we can always scale factor returns bychanging the dollar investment in the long-short strategy. The crucial assumption isconditional independence of average strategy returns. A certain form of conditionalindependence is unavoidable for Bayesian hierarchical modeling
57—probably unrealistic
for our application. We can easily think of scenarios in which average returns of differentstrategies are correlated, even when population means are known. For example, it is wellknown that two of the most popular factors, the Fama and French (1992) HML and SMB,are correlated.
H2. The ﬁrst-step population parameters μ
i’s andγi’s are assumed to be generated from two other
parametric distributions: μi’s are independently generated from a normal distribution, and
γi’s are simply generated from a Bernoulli distribution, that is, γi=0 with probability p0.
The normality assumption for the μi’s requires the reported Xi’s to randomly represent
either long/short or short/long strategy returns. If researchers have a tendency to report
55We choose to present the full Bayes’ approach. An alternative approach—the empirical Bayes’ approach—is
closely related to the BHY method that controls the false-discovery rate (FDR). See Storey (2003) and Efron and
Tibshirani (2002) for the empirical Bayes’ interpretation of FDR. For details on the empirical Bayes’ method,
see Efron et al. (2001), and Efron (2004), 2008). For an in-depth investigation of the differences between the fullBayes’and the empirical-Bayes’approach, see Scott and Berger (2010). For an application of the empirical-Bayes’method in ﬁnance, see Markowitz and Xu (1994).
56See Meng and Dempster (1987) and Whittemore (2007) for more works on the Bayesian approach in hypothesistesting.
57Conditional independence is crucial for the Bayesian framework and the construction of posterior likelihoods.
Although it can be extended to incorporate special dependence structures, there is no consensus on how to
systematically handle dependence. See Brown et al. (2014) for a discussion of independence in Bayesian multipletesting. They also propose a spatial dependence structure into a Bayesian testing framework.

positive abnormal returns, we need to randomly assign to these returns plus/minus signs.
The normality assumptions in both H1 and H2 are important as they are necessary to
guarantee the properness of the posterior distributions.
H3. Finally, the two variance variables τ2andσ2follow a joint prior distribution π1and the
probability p0follows a prior distribution π2.
Objective or “neutral” priors for π1andπ2can be speciﬁed as:
π1(τ2,σ2)∝ (τ2+σ2)−2,
π2(p0) = Uniform(0 ,1).
Under this framework, the joint conditional likelihood function for Xi’s is simply a product
of individual normal likelihood functions and the posterior probability that γi=1 (discovery)
can be calculated by applying Bayes’ law. When the number of trials is large, to calculate theposterior probability, we need efﬁcient methods, such as importance sampling, which involveshigh-dimensional integrals.
One beneﬁt of a Bayesian framework for multiple testing is that the multiplicity penalty term is
already embedded. In the frequentists’ framework, this is done by introducing FWER or FDR. In aBayesian framework, the so-called “Ockham’s razor effect”
58automatically adjusts the posterior
probabilities when more factors are simultaneously tested.59Simulation studies in Scott and Berger
(2006) show how the discovery probabilities for a few initial signals increase when more noise isadded to the original sample.
However, there are several shortcomings for the Bayesian approach. Some of them are speciﬁc to
the context of our application and the others are generic to the Bayesian multiple testing framework.
At least two issues arise when applying the Bayesian approach to our factor selection problem.
First, we do not observe all tried factors. While we back out the distribution of hidden factorsparametrically under the frequentist framework, it is not clear how the missing data and themultiple testing problems can be simultaneously solved under the Bayesian framework. Second,the hierarchical testing framework may be overly restrictive. Both independence and normalityassumptions can have a large impact on the posterior distributions. Although normality can besomewhat relaxed by using alternative distributions, the scope of alternative distributions is limitedas there are only a few distributions that can guarantee the properness of the posterior distributions.Independence, as we previously discussed, is likely to be violated in our context. In contrast, thethree adjustment procedures under the frequentists’ framework are able to handle complex datastructures since they rely on only fundamental probability inequalities to restrict their objectivefunction—the type I error rate.
There are a few general concerns about the Bayesian multiple testing framework. First, it is not
clear what to do after obtaining the posterior probabilities for individual hypotheses. Presumably,we should ﬁnd a cutoff probability Pand reject all hypotheses that have a posterior discovery
probability larger than P. But then we return to the initial problem of ﬁnding an appropriate cutoff
p-value, which is not a clear task. Scott and Berger (2006) suggest a decision-theoretic approach that
chooses the cutoff Pby minimizing a loss function. The parameters of the loss function, however,
are again subjective. Second, the Bayesian posterior distributions are computationally challenging.
We document 300 factors, but there are potentially many more if missing factors are taken into
account. When Mgets large, importance sampling is a necessity. However, results of importance
sampling rely on simulations and subjective choices of the centers of the probability distributions
58See Jefferys and Berger (1992).
59Intuitively, more complex models are penalized because extra parameters involve additional sources of
uncertainty. Simplicity is rewarded in a Bayesian framework as simple models produce sharp predictions. Seethe discussions in Scott (2009).

for random variables. Consequently, two researchers trying to calculate the same quantity might
obtain very different results. Moreover, in multiple testing, the curse of dimensionality generatesadditional risks for Bayesian statistical inference.
60These technical issues create additional hurdles
for the application of the Bayesian approach.
